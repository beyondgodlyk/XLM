The concept of making pasta in front of the customer still works just as well.
One of the best fast-casual pasta restaurants.
The biggest problem is finding a seat :)
1 hour wait and not even fries ...

The same #Miznon as in Tel Aviv as friendly, as good.
Probably the best #kebab known #foudfood #streetfood

The BB burger is pretty good!
Cheap beers and a friendly, unpretentious bar
The terrace is closed from 8pm, too bad
Chic but not pretentious.
Enjoy the view over the kitchens and the high ceilings.
The food is good but could do with a little more presentation.
Of course, enjoy the terrace.
This bar is a delight, where you can eat at lunchtime or have a drink in the evening, always in a pleasant atmosphere that puts you in a good mood!
The pastries are a treat!
A little small upstairs.
The location is very good.

Very good discovery :) good burgers :)
<NAME>: the best milkshake I've ever had (with Oreo) also try their JD Burger flamb√©ed in Whisky!
It's too crowded.
Average quality, I've seen better fireworks, the taste is average.
Bravo for marketing...
The quantity of 5 ravioli fighting for 12.70 euros.
Go in August after 1:30 p.m. there are fewer people and the indoor terrace is top !!!! üç∑‚òÄ
Iberian board and cheese platter, a winning combination.
The products are really quality!
Bobun overpriced (‚Ç¨26), the room is often full and noisy.
Otherwise, it's pretty cool.
Very long service, 40min just to take the order.
It's getting worse and worse :-(
Good service but very average quality for the price.
Test once but won't go again 2.

But the loir tea and tarts are delicious!
The setting and welcome were warm.
The tartare was not bad, but the presentation of the dishes was really neat.

The best terrace in Paris from 1pm to 6pm, with the sun shining down on you!
Entrecote as always!
Rue Nollet or rue Lemercier, it's worth it!
Excellent coffee even if ristretto too acidic, divine carrot cake.
A bohemian ambience that's awkward to look at from certain angles.
Sluggish service, not very resourceful.
Disappointed with the address, not the food.
Ask to sit at the bar to watch the Sushi Master.
The fish cuts are exceptional, worthy of a true Japanese.
The little garden is cool.
Nice bar, but the waiter is borderline polite.
There are tons of bars in the area, so don't bother...
To get a table in the garden, you need to come as soon as it opens at 19:00.
Menu prices are affordable.
3 types of menu, regular fries, with cheddar cheese... the burgers are good and light.
Cheddar fries are fatty... eat in moderation
The cat burger!!!
Yum yum and everything else too ;)
Organic vegetable stew is a great choice!
The food is very good, the service impeccable and all for a reasonable price.
Don't be fooled by decoration or exterior appearance.
Delicious oysters, great wine list, cocktails to match the candelaria team and the glass!
The place is superb, there's nothing to say.
On the other hand, it's better to enjoy a drink than a meal (not exceptional).
The terrace is huge and very pleasant!
It's a shame we can't eat well here!
Btw very fair prices for fields
best raspberry tart in paris!
Warm welcome Polite and helpful waitresses Quality food and products
Super Korean barbecue The Bibimbap is excellent too!
Delicious!especially the macaron a la ROSE,but the tail....and just unbearable.....
A well-earned break on the sunny 24 deg terrace
The service is deplorable and the room often disgusting, but for those in need of NY, it's like a little American air.

Dishes between 17 and 25 euros

Go during the day in fine weather.
Excellent cuisine and beautiful restaurant
A spicy restaurant!
The sun is shining in this Colombian restaurant.
Dishes really cheap (9-13‚Ç¨) but very very average quality.
Fairly average burger and fries
I haven't eaten such good Melon Pan since my last combini in Tokyo, and even then, Aki's are homemade...
THE bobo bar in Belleville.
I recommend happy hour every evening from 6pm to 9pm.
Beer ‚Ç¨3.50.
A beer to enjoy on a sunny terrace!
The place is cool, but don't go there for lunch: the food isn't great.
Good location, but very noisy because often crowded
Good pizzas, but certainly not the best in Paris.
The tiramisu, on the other hand, is exceptional
Don't come to 14 in this place.
You'll have a hard time.
Hearty dishes and a mountain schnitzel akin to a Gladine Charonne or Batignolles!
Nice service but a bit long at the end :)
Random service but finally real Japanese sushi in Paris!
You have to queue to get a seat.
Perfect in summer with the terrace!
The best pizzas I've ever had in France.
Bcp de choix, peut-√™tre Trop :-)
One of the finest specialty coffees in Paris.
Sit on the bench for a moment and enjoy espressos from Has Bean or elsewhere.
The buble teas are very good and creative!
Fruit beads from molecular gastronomy!
The lemon tart is formidable...
Stay away from the door in winter!
The sets were magnificent!
The oysters are really delicious!
Mont Blanc has been served from the same recipe since 1903.
I approve of the Derby Daiquiri (for its fruity freshness based on orange juice) and the Engenho da Picante (for its sublime hint of spiciness from the Thai chillies)
Very good and inexpensive, good atmosphere, excellent rock music.
My HQ for the past 8 years... always charming waitresses, pure Mexico DF atmosphere and typical, delicious Latin American (and not just Mexican) dishes.
don't miss the opportunity
The most bobo bar in Paris.
It's really impressive.
I didn't think it was possible to push the concept this far
Very on top for the first time...we must have disturbed them...
Expensive for dinner, but the terrace is great - there's always plenty of room and great exposure to the sun
The most mastered "pour over" coffee in the city.
The pizzas are good but it's a factory
Enjoy the lobster menu...
Coffee, yes.
Brunch, not so much.
Fall back on the Franprix next door with its discounted packs of Pepitos.
In all the years I've been going to this restaurant, I've...
The service is always perfect...
Except that today we were curdling our buns on the terrace, but very delicious!
To be redone as soon as possible!!!
Nice setting and team, but you can do better in a Paris bistro: soft home fries, home-made dessert a little waterlogged.
3/5
***: Filled with people and therefore a little noisy, the choice of burgers is impressive, and the Pastrami is delicious.
Don't forget to arrive early: reservations are not possible, and the queue gets long!
Service a little long, but the food is really good!
Service can be slow, but the setting is nice
Better food in Sweden....
10.5‚Ç¨ for most pitas.
Small quantity, but quite good.
On the other hand, service is slow and unpleasant...
Delicious, even if sometimes too crowded at lunchtime.
More relaxed around 2 p.m
Provide cakes while you wait
It feels strange ....
Cocktails and bar atmosphere
Marcel's burger is a must-try, as is the burger of the day.
The Saturday/Sunday brunch is very nice and the waiters are always smiling
Excellent Guatemalan coffee
A friendly atmosphere and round-the-clock service at a reasonable price
A sandwich is enough to fill you up, and their nan bread is really delicious
Just delicious bagels, with a small grocery store of American products to boot.
A little out of the way, but very pleasant, with a very nice decor.
the menu features hundreds of different dishes, ideal for having ribs, flamkeuches, cr√®pes and fondue on the same table.
Far from the best bagels I've ever had, but the place is nice
A coffee at the counter in the morning, and the day gets off to a good start :D
the bagels are good, the Q/P ratio is just right and what's more, they're open continuously until 10pm, which is great! the other little plus is the mini American grocery store in the restaurant!
Nice place and the Chile wine is very good ^^
Coffee and g√¢teau st-honor√©, buy macaroons as gifts
Avoid the rather disappointing brunch.
Overrated place.
a station concourse, and that's saying a lot! if only we ate hot and good... but no!
Typical northern dishes, not too expensive, very pleasant terrace, warm welcome and faultless service.
Don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed.

I'm not sure how common this is here, but the service was very friendly.
Very good value for money for this restaurant a stone's throw from the Champs Elys√©es!
Try their mojito and tartar parmesan, you won't be disappointed!
The only downside to this place: the music is too loud!
Duck barbecue!
Nice bar, but you'll have to come back for the friendliness!
There's no signage on the gray facade, but there's a bar/resto.
A nice, cosy place for a date, with a selection of excellent cocktails.
An ideal bar for an aperitif, especially on sunny days, with its terrace, or a quick bite to eat before a theater or movie!
The ultimate burger no longer exists :'( but asking for ultimate fries still gives you 1 euro off cheese fries!
The best: the Mont Blanc, enormous (filling, according to its detractors), with a good volume of whipped cream and a thick layer of chestnut.
Curry and other dishes just like over there.
The cheese board is great
Rillettes trop bien
c rond, c au chocolat et c un delice. et la tarte au citron, celle √† la framboise, hum! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
A great tourist trap!
The quality of service leaves much to be desired in view of the prices charged.
Forget Hokkaido and Higuma, these ramen + gyoza are superior.
What could be better than a moka under the Lille sun?
The kings of bentos!
I also recommend their freshly squeezed fruit juices!
no restaurant tickets, no credit card... it's shameful, I'm gone! and behind the counter we see the pile of ready-made galettes !!!!
good value for money in the area, pleasant terrace
Authentic and generous cuisine, nans cooked to perfection, organic flour, top!
Small quantity but quality at a fair price üëç.
Ask for the garden, very quiet
Disgusting to flee urgently because everyone talks about the service but the food is worse than anything
No home-squeezed orange juice, just Tropicana.
Plus a shitty welcome: that says it all.
Doesn't make you want to spend 100 at the Train Bleu...
We're grazed by great Puerto Rican actors...
Good+ simple+ not too expensive+ friendly boss = packed to the gills
As crowded as ever, but very nice.
The bartenders are really nice, the barmaids (almost) all...
The food is good (very decent and not at all expensive), the customers are friendly and the beer is good
Happy hour pint ‚Ç¨2.90.
You'll have to get there early if you want to take advantage of it, because it's packed fast...
Very good Welsh with Maroilles!
3.5 ‚Ç¨ for hot chocolate and 4 ‚Ç¨ for pastries.
It's good and the atmosphere is cool.
Huge sunny terrace when available and great desserts to share
A little noisy but the cakes are delicious.
Ideal for a winter snack.
good food and superb setting, with a quiet terrace overlooking the square.
BUT, plate and service not precise and rigorous enough for the price. the waitress was half-naked, wtf?
Avoid weekends, which are always too crowded.
Perfect welcome, and homemade hot chocolate for ‚Ç¨3.
Don't go at peak times in winter, as the wait is very long and the place is really nice
Choose a table as soon as you've picked up the menu, then go to the kitchens.
Otherwise waiting in the kitchens and difficulty finding a seat
As copious as ever, and the quality of the products used remains unchanged despite the reputation of the place.
It's a small, often crowded space, but that's the sign that this establishment is the place to be.
The menus are not very interesting if you don't like udong.
Kimchi is an industrial product.
The katsu curry is delicious.
Only drawback: no water carafes
At checkout, ask for the secret menu: triple triple, cheese fries, ultimate style fries, protein style burger, ultimate style burger, veggie burger, etc.
Prices, welcome and cuisine are excellent.
The place that confirmed to me that I like savoury more than sweet.
Overdose for me.
If you're coming in a group, it's best to designate one person to save seats.
Thin, crispy pizzas and fast service, highly recommended
Oily, unrefined and expensive for what it is, "sock juice" coffee lives up to its name.
The orange juice is not at will, whereas everything on the menu is at will
Kahlua gourmet coffee is great!
One of the best burger places in Paris!
Reservations are not possible, so come early!
Crispy ta√Ø ta√Ø salmon tartare and Himalaya des empereurs for dessert.
Cool miso soup and Don de Boeuf to die for!
Bobo or not...
It depends on the time of day...
So what?
Very hearty brunch and pleasant service ...
Ideal for a gentle wake-up call on a Sunday morning!
Excellent brunch with fresh and delicious products, friendly staff
Not the back seats.
Not the terrace.
Delicious but a little expensive in the evening (big difference with lunch)
1 meal, 2 cockroaches...
It spoils the experience :-(
Original, friendly little caf√© where you can buy the coffee you've drunk!
*** : An excellent terrace in the neighborhood, the interior design is also very successful in this historic building and the prices are reasonable.
A keeper!
Very busy at weekends.
4.90 for a gourmet coffee: 3 petits marvels and an espresso.
10‚Ç¨ menu (burger + fries) - 8‚Ç¨ burger only - 3‚Ç¨ home fries - 3‚Ç¨ Coleslaw salad - 4‚Ç¨ cheesecake
Small store, quickly overcrowded, busy but friendly staff.
The pastries are good and L'equinoxe is THE pleasant surprise!
In 2013 the service had to change!
Very warm welcome and pleasant, helpful service.
The first French Starbucks opened in 2004.
No kidding, you think it's still hype 6 years later?
A sure bet in the neighborhood, come early for the terrace or veranda.
Once you've got the hang of it, it's pretty cool, albeit very noisy...
Take a bottle of chilien, then a bottle of chilien and finish with a bottle of chilien
Very good cheesecake!
Don't hesitate to try the pastrami :)
A good plan to avoid overcrowding on rue sainte anne!
Trendy, stylish, delicious
Delicious coffee cream incredibly large and curry chicken fire with vegetables
It's not great and way too expensive.
The setting alone is worth the detour.
Mediocre wine, mediocre food, mediocre dessert.
The world's best lemon tart
But what a shitty bar, I've never seen anything like it.
Unpleasant service (and I'm being polite here, not like the bar owner), disgusting beer... blacklist.
The sweet and savoury cr√™pes are delicious, and the artisanal cider very good.
Too bad no card in payment.
I'll be back
Perfect welcome and service Fresh, inexpensive product Excellent pizza and take-away option
Disappointed it's noisy
slow but honest, I don't agree with the service critics
The service is very approximate.
Big disappointment for the burgers: despite the tempting recipes on the menu, the buns are industrial and the meat of poor quality.
Beautiful, relaxed setting, idyllic in summer.
Good atmosphere, but service a little slow
The only real advantage is its terrace in the station.
Very big disappointment: not a single pleasant surprise on the plate, disgusting toilets, and a mistake on the bill...
I really don't recommend this place...
The cocktails aren't bad.
The food is good and fusion-oriented, with a special mention for the sushi. The place is trendy and original.
A sort of mix of Japanese canteen and blade runner setting.
Very nice, conveniently located next to the Canal Saint-Martin and not far from R√©publique, but all too often overcrowded (the price of success?)
Very trendy, so prices are affected... but the decor and food are worth it
Bagel Top!
Refurbished premises :)
who knows the timetable? nothing on the web.
for lunch it's healthy, it's my friend's restaurant <NAME>.
The interior is clean and cosy, but seats are expensive once the temperature drops!
We feel guilty dwelling on them.
Home-style cakes at great prices.
The inari are royal.
But you have to get up early.
Picturesque atmosphere, very good viennoiserie!
But be patient for brunch and if you come in a group, everyone must arrive together lol
Here's our video review: <URL>.
It was a great evening with friends.
I hope this helps you make your choice!
Soft-boiled egg and goat's cheese crotin salad!
Great for a weekend brunch!
The best cakes ever :)
Try Funghi + chicken.
It's not on the menu, but ask the chef!
Great service and great burgers!
Obviously the "African" hot chocolate... beware of the queue, but if the weather is fine, you can take it to go and enjoy it at the Tuileries just across the street ;)
The cocktails are really good and full-bodied (for connoisseurs).
A little expensive, though.
Nice terrace but very noisy.
Disappointed by the Duck Parmentier... too heavy.
Outside of rush hour, very pleasant bar and good mixed boards!
Horrible... service, food, nothing's right.
Don't fall into this tourist trap.
For something to drink after a meal in a restaurant; plenty of room on the terrace, but often in the shade
Uh hip?!
Creepy surely...
Good good good good good !!!!
i had a Miso Ramen with roast pork and extra egg.
The broth was a little too salty for my taste.
A restaurant to visit, but not to queue up for.
quick, inexpensive, good-quality dinner with a great atmosphere!
It's not bad, but the service sucks and the staff are absolutely unfriendly ...
The boards are good, and the prices are really low for the neighborhood!
We caught a glimpse of Fran√ßois Hollande on JT JAP :)
His mother is so good!
Very quiet and peaceful place.
Nothing is expensive, everything is homemade!

I recommend vanilla roibos with 3/4 soya foam and 1/4 water !!!!
Top service and top food for a very reasonable price.
Quite a chic restaurant in the heart of the 6th arrondissement.
Despite its spaciousness, the establishment has a subdued, intimate ambience.
Try out the mezzanine for cocktails.
Terrace with lovely view of the Arche de la D√©fense, could do with more space.
Long service with little follow-up.
Several drinks, but not even an amuse-bouche...
The bagels are really hearty and there are also American treats!

Arrive by 12 noon on weekdays to avoid waiting times
Best value for money in the neighbourhood!
And don't forget the thyme-grilled entrecote and knife-pressed fries (‚Ç¨12.50) and the music!
Disappointed by the quality of the kitchen.
We'd expect better, given the prices üòî
A cosy place, finely vintage, where you will find a potato omelette, dirty tarts, wonderful cakes, attentive and gentle hosts, in a cheerful bobo atmosphere

Refined dishes...
Excellent veal chop, creamy cheesecake and especially the French toast :)
very stylish place with a view of the whole of Paris
Some don't hesitate to cross the whole of Paris to taste the famous lemon meringue pie.

A huge queue to buy a galette des rois...
Very decent food but waiter more than unpleasant!!!!

pizzas until 5am!
Pie, tea and dessert
Capirinha / Mojitos and Tartar with pesto are particularly recommended.
Very nice by the canal.
Attractive and not excessive menu.
Good dishes of the day :)
The pizzas are very, very good.
On the other hand, it's very crowded, which is the weak point of many restaurants in the area.
Damn good chicken burger
Meat a little dry, burgers well filled and generous portion of fries.
Not as good as Big Fernand, which for me remains the benchmark burger in Paris for the time being ;)
Deplorable to drink and enjoy a marvellous product in plastic or polystyrene.
This reflects a lack of knowledge about sustainable development.

Gyoza not bad too.
Very good authentic Japanese canteen!

The raspberry tart, the Cara√Øbe, the Fraisier and the lemon tart ...

The juices and desserts are delicious.
Generally a lot of waiting, victim of their success :)
As in New York, you can have a Budweiser (typical American beer!)

In short, brilliant!
Great coffee mastery!
Breakfast at its best <3
Good cocktails and a relaxed atmosphere.
It feels like the same team as candaleria.
Delicious pasta, but the whole concept of the restaurant is wrong.
In the end, because of the dishes prepared in front of us, we spend more time standing in line than eating.

So take a bottle of wine to wait.
Burgers halfway between In'n'Out and Five Guys.

The place itself is nothing special and a bit noisy.
Good address but not mythical in my eyes
A haven of peace and wonderful homemade pastries
A very long wait if there are several of you....
Very few fries with the burger, but very good nonetheless...
Great for Sunday brunches!
Feel free to personalize your pasta ;)
The back room could have become my favorite place in Paris, but alas, it overlooks the not-so-clean open kitchen, whose hood leaves something to be desired.
Beautiful and unprofessional servers.
Nice concept, but the quality isn't up to scratch.11‚Ç¨ for a fried hot dog without sauce ...
Rather expensive food for what's on the plate, but excellent wine, very friendly waiters & stunning view.
We love it!
For the summer it's free mussels and French fries 2x a week!
A deli like those found on the other side of the Atlantic, ideal for a pastrami sandwich.
In the morning, when you're early, because there are always lots of people between 8.30 and 9 a.m....
The map is a little hard to understand, but basically: everything in pitot
Very, very variable atmosphere.
just for a drink... no more!

One of Toulouse's best tea rooms!

Make a reservation as this is a very popular restaurant!
A great neighbourhood address that makes you feel good at any time of day!
Their burgers are delicious (fries of uneven quality), their wines always good, the service super.
Just to have a drink and enjoy the terraces of this historic building.
Excellent coffee in a decor that's both minimalist and warm, thanks to the exposed beams and high-quality funk soundtrack.
In a word, the anti-Starbucks!
Bar indeed cheap but happy hour at 2.70‚Ç¨ ONLY on the stella and there has "never been free couscous on Saturday night" according to the waitress (big mitos on ALL sites!!)
Mont blanc is delicious but the service is not good
Cool concept of the double galette.
Unfortunately too fatty.
And the atmosphere is a bit factory-like.
The home-made dessert counter is simply sublime!

(But in moderation).
The JD Burger is just beautiful
Too much waiting and disorganization, too bad, but beyond that the brunch is not bad
Better choice of meats than before, including a 320g rib-eye steak, a 380g rib-eye steak, and a 550g rib-eye steak.
Not for sushi, but for tempura, gyosas... and even edamame!
perfect for lunch good value for money
The donations are very good. Try the sesame panacotta
The gyosas are a delight, and I tried the pork ramen with extra egg.
It was very good but really fatty!

On the other hand, you'll have to wait a bit, as the service is a bit slow!
Very good choice of daily specials
Try the Beef Bourgignon pita, delicious!
The ramen is fat, in every sense of the word.
You'll come out feeling full.

I queued for about 25 minutes on a Saturday night, but it's worth it.
La mara√Æch√®re was excellent.
Best pancake ever.
Very friendly waiter, but you can't pay by credit card.
The atmosphere...,...but it's a bit expensive compared with the surrounding area and for what it is, and it's one of the only restaurants in Paris that doesn't accept credit cards !!!!
Passable dishes and too much fat.
Unsympathetic management.
Nice subdued atmosphere with dj at weekends.
The cucumber cocktail is a must-try, as is the rum selection.

Thursday, free couscous!!!
Nice decor, good Mexican food, good value for money
Rude staff, tables not cleaned and staff grumble when asked to do so. Dirty glasses and cutlery.
The concept is fun!

The terrace is very pleasant, a must in Lille for a treat.
For the Mont-Blanc with chestnuts üòç
just try the onion soup!

This explains why.
The hunchback's tapenade

I love caf√© cr√®me.
CLIMBING VEAL to the point of falling over and being unable to get up from the chair

If you leave koh lantha yes but otherwise to flee
Nice card and this place left me a good memory üòâüíã
Waiting and waiting and waiting!
Good but not crazy.
A little disappointed by all the flan you read about this fast-food restaurant... the meat is even thinner than at Mcdo, the secret sauce looks like an Algerian kebab sauce, ...
Good portions but reheated pasta with sauce, not made a la minute which one would expect given the price, so for me a very very average value for money
Really economical menus are available, but only at lunchtime.
A little chilly in winter, but a torrid atmosphere on DJ meeting days and evenings.
Pizza with foie gras stays on the stomach
The floor is very noisy, and it's not easy to find a seat.
But it's better than Starbucks!

Reasonable prices, cool decor and atmosphere!
It's expensive and not very good!
The only advantage is that you can sit on the terrace inside the station.
Otherwise I'll never go to Express Bleu again
It's very long when there aren't even that many people, but for the quality there's nothing to say.
I've just waited 20 minutes on my feet
Very good brasserie with nice people inside.
Recently renovated.
The decor alone, by Starck, is worth the detour!
Impeccable, charming service and a menu to suit everyone, even if the prices are still high!
Desserts are also worth trying!
Nice bar, cool atmosphere and pleasant terrace, good burger but rather excessive prices for drinks: pints at 8‚Ç¨!
As good as ever, but today the service was poor
Don't go without sampling their fabulous hot chocolate.
For this reason alone, Le loir dans la th√©i√®re is well worth the detour.
The best cr√™perie in Paris, without question.
On the other hand, victim of its own success, the cr√™perie josselin is a real anthill, crowded from morning to night.
Very, very good burgers not far from Place de la R√©publique, with vegetarian options on request üëç
Excellent pitas to eat on the go, great atmosphere, friendly...

Don't try it without a reservation, it's almost mission impossible. Not really recommended for a dinner for two, rather noisy atmosphere
Great filter coffee!
Favorite place! But before you eat the specialties flamb√©ed in rum for breakfast, order something savory first! Otherwise, you'll be a bit stuffed) Impressive and delicious all the same!
Ideal for a quick getaway to the USA, minus airfare and jet lag.
One regret: no onion rings on the menu...
For a "Plateau" breakfast on red benches.
Montreux live broadcasts
A lovely surprise in the heart of the 11th arrondissement!
The desserts are not to be missed!

At this price, they could put in real orange juice and chocolate chip brioche that isn't stale :/
The best Merveilleux Chocolat in Lille
Mont-Blanc really is the speciality!
The setting is simply WOW.
The service is fast but not very friendly...
If you're looking for a luxurious snack, this is the place to be!

Eating a vanilla waffle
Try the fried chicken it's huge !!!
A relatively classic menu, but very good dishes.
Very busy at lunchtime, so get there as early as you can!

Estaminet decor, good beers and a great location in the heart of Old Lille.
I usually love this place, but tonight it just wasn't right.
Astroblond beer ordered, Kirin served and no excuses or replacements.
Dessert: dry old green tea cheesecake!
The food is quite good, but the canteen-like atmosphere is disappointing if you're going there for a romantic date...
To be avoided at lunchtime, there are too many people and the way they operate makes the experience unpleasant.
Delicious!
Pastries that make you want to be hungry and rich
But why can such a charming place serve such mediocre food, it's so hopeless?
Everything is wrong with the setting: unbearable muzzak, useless food.
Sadness!
Lovely and friendly service :) good food, the mashed potatoes are really great :)
No room for 15...
F**k!!!
Parisian bento and cheese cake = the perfect menu

The waiters are exceptionally kind.
Historic and unmissable!
Very good, service up to expectations.
Since the renovation, the room seems a little cold.
A good address for a treat all the same!
Inappropriate service!!!
Incredible to see servers acting like this with customers.
Good value for money in Paris.
The large salads are excellent.
The menu lacks a side dish of home fries
Very poor reception for the #4sqday Team :(
You have to be patient to get a table, and the waiters aren't always patient, but the pies are worth it!

I recommend the crepinette de canard and its fois gras poele!
A little pricey, but perfect for discovering some of the little pleasures of Japanese cuisine, such as melon pan („É°„É≠„É≥„Éë„É≥).
Boudin, duck breast, creme br√ªl√©e .
Everything was excellent.

An interminable wait!
The place for Arabs!
The location of Fouquet s is wonderful on the Champs Elysees but in the bistro do not look for the French they do not prefer to take coffee at fouquet s!!!

I really liked the galettes.
A tight Ethiopian to start the afternoon
Not too expensive certainly, the duck and cake were delicious

Salad around 9 / 10e even in the evening and the rest in the same spirit of pricing!
After waiting 50 minutes (we were told 15-20), we were FINALLY placed.
It's not worth the wait, so stay away!
Veal belly is excellent if you like tripe.
Great atmosphere and a nice little dessert. A relaxing moment after work.
For me, the best ramen in Paris!
A little tip for lunch: come before 12 o'clock to have a chance of finding a seat... Ittadakimasu! \o/

Superb setting, especially in the evening üòâ
There was a time when this place was all the rage.
Today, it's just another Coste for tourists.
The view alone is worth the effort.
More suited to an end-of-day drink than a dinner party.
Still good and cool after all these years.
Their daily burgers are surprisingly good
The food's great, the concept's great and if you're lucky you'll find a top-notch waitress.
Negative point: very expensive!!!

Great for a good burger and poached eggs.
A very long wait, only to be told that there's no room.

The menu is original and the dishes delicious, as are the cocktails, especially the cucumber cocktail.
Just delicious!
Pita bread to die for ...
So soft!
For an informal lunch on the go ;)
A little pricey (‚Ç¨9 pint of white after 11pm) but nice
Finally calm, ideal for the end of the day with a glass of wine
Hearty meal, home fries, good drinks list and a great atmosphere.
Personal taste: I prefer this one to the one at Jussieu.
Otherwise, same opinion: good value for money and burgers in the Parisian average, but has the merit of not sounding pretentious.
excellent bo bun, super efficient service! a good address
One of my canteens.
Come and have coffee with us @<ID> it's just a stone's throw away ÓêÖ
Huge, high-quality burgers
Very pleasant new terrace.
It changed before there was no glitter
It's a true Japanese with Japanese!
Inexpensive afternoon and evening bar for 10 minutes or two hours.
Full on weekend evenings.
Authentic northern brasserie and delicious food!
Please note that the pig's trotter now closes at night.
The opening times are unclear, but it's probably closed early in the morning...
crowded and shoulder to shoulder!
Can stop serving at 1 a.m. without warning and yell at customers.
But the mere sight of √âlise is worth every sacrifice.
It's all very sweet...
Much ado about nothing
Top-notch, but a lot of waiting to be served.
If you like eggs, go wild!
Authentic Japanese!
The skewers are not frozen and the sashimi are fresh.
You don't pay much for real Japanese.
Try the cinnamon hot chocolate :D delicious!!!
After an unsuccessful first try, the second was unfortunately no better: food just OK, small portions and, above all, not very friendly staff.
Hearty crepes, fast service, no reservations.
Affordable prices, too bad the service isn't pleasant.
Le V√©g√©tarien rated 2/5 by FatFood!
The lok lak bon is not super expensive.
Interminable wait for a burger that's really not that good, buns that don't matter, limp and undercooked fries, and it's not cheap.
In short, to be avoided, especially as there really are better places to go.
Very good Thai restaurant in Belleville
The delicious food, the rustic decor, the efficient service... even the Bretons find their way here, that's for sure.
As for brunch, it was fine, but in the evening, if like me you don't want mice dragging you around, stay away!
It's infested with mice at night, and for them that's normal!
Average quality, the bread was cold.
Pretty good, but not worth the hour's wait out front.
In love with bagels made in NYC?
You've come to the right place.
All FredFarid's spirits come to Jeanette one day, so keep an eye out!
Certainly one of the best Japanese restaurants in Paris!
Extremely greasy
Extremely slow service even though the terrace was half empty.
Rice loaded with butter.
In short, I regret having come here to eat.
Customer service is average.
"The place to be after work, apparently!
A charming, friendly little tea room where you can spend a pleasant moment with friends :)
The best burrata!!!!!
Shitty bar where the waiters are assholes.
It's a massive racket when you walk past, for a 9.8‚Ç¨ pint.
Their false sympathy is verified as soon as you sit down (very tightly)...
5 errors during a dinner ( error on the starter, dessert before the main course, cooking error, dessert error, then the bill ).
The service and food do not live up to the reputation of the place
Don't ask for spicy and watch what they put in their woks ;) as it's not always what's written on the card.
Board games, but the bar is far too bohemian
Very nice bar in Belleville.
When it's hot, everyone sits outside.
The cr√™pes are good, but service can leave something to be desired (I had to ask 3 times for a carafe of water).
No fruit juice (Tropicana) but the last straw was the waiter when I offered to point out that a CAFARD had fallen on my table from the glass roof: "ah √ßa c'est pas nous c'est la gare"!
A popular spot, often praised for its mediocre burgers.
Industrial buns, no sauce, just average topping.
The fries aren't worth it
The best burger in Paris!
I'm of age, and I do what I want to do with my little body.
10‚Ç¨ lunch menu!
With a bowl of cider, 1 savoury crepe, 1 sweet crepe
Very nice decor, top dishes (delicious salmon)
One of the only authentic Japanese bouibouis in the neighborhood.
The place is small, so be warned.
Specialties include takoyaki, a kind of octopus dumpling, and fried tofu.
I recommend the bavette and its baked apple when there's no more daytime special.
Don't forget to order a pitcher of fresh fruit juice!
The half-baked chocolate moelleux is not bad at all
The best crepes in Paris's 14th arrondissement!
Good discovery, the menus are inexpensive but the quality is close to that of a burger chain.
Great room and very fast service
Don't take the CB!
A long queue for the order and then to pick up your burger!
But these are worth it!
I think they changed the fries but I still think they're good!
Stop farting higher than your ass and the waiter will treat you like a loyal customer.
Chic canteen with ethno-bobo decor, ultra-fresh dishes inspired by Japanese cuisine and new organic trends.
A wide variety of bentos to eat in or take away.
The service is poor.
The place is full all the time, thanks to low prices for the neighborhood.
The food is decent.
Mandatory waiting outside.
Only complete groups are installed.
Avoid coming in odd numbers, as all even-numbered tables will go before you.
Once you're settled in, enjoy!
For the price, you'll be served copiously, but don't expect any finesse...
Le Diane for a 4-hand dinner follow the program, <NAME> likes to invite a companion for a moment of Culinary Art
Bbq Burger is my favorite.
Take a look at <URL>
As someone who has been to quite a few Starbucks, I couldn't wait to visit this one...friendly staff and very clean coffee.
Fabulous seating and architecture.
I'm a delighted Starbuckeuse ;)
The traditional mont blanc and chocolate frapp√© are delicious and synonymous with a happy afternoon.
Brunch at ‚Ç¨16 - sick prices!
On the other hand, service was a little rushed...
We're being gently pushed out the door ;-)
nice setting, a little noisy for dinner but perfect for a dinner party with friends.
I tried last week's pot au feu and was disappointed... as for the rest, it's a very nice establishment...
The atmosphere varies (as do the waiters), but it's still a very pleasant terrace and a must for a break on rue de la gait√©!
There's always a queue in the evening after 7.30pm, but if you're an early bird, no worries.
Carrot cake, eggplant cake.
I eat here often.
Good value for money and wood-fired pizzas.
Very good value for money on the meal, borderline too copious!
Very good service, nothing to complain about, apart from the impossibility of paying by credit card
The room upstairs is very nice and cosy.
The show welcomes many expats.
Take the chocolate - raspberry.
Perfect for a Scandinavian break.
Few tables in the large outdoor courtyard, even though it's full, so the area remains quiet.
It was good, it was organic, but it took forever...
The place is beautiful, inside and out... I love it!
Even if it's not crazy, it's pretty good!
The service, on the other hand, is not up to the standard of the place!
Very slow preparation.
Most of the time only one register is open
Breakfast in Paris
The Crazy Bananas is a delight!!!
To be enjoyed while watching the Fl√¢neurs stroll along the Grand'Place <3
Ideal for a tea break.
The homemade cakes are delicious
Very disappointed, the dishes have totally changed and so have the prices.
The market caf√© has become a tourist magnet.
Without a doubt the best value for money restaurant in the neighbourhood!
And, when the weather's nice, they hand out white straw hats, and that's cool!
The burgers are top-notch!
Unbearable wait at the toilet!
A single cabinet for such a large Starbucks, that's nonsense.
I love this "hidden garden", this Scandinavian oasis in the middle of Paris.
So zen to get lost in on a Sunday.
Best (real) Japanese in Paris.
Expect to wait a long time, but otherwise a pleasant place to have an unusual coffee
Prices are 4 euros higher than in Germany.
But the concept is as good as ever
Bar that does the job
Good restaurant at a very affordable price, but the new waitress is a real idiot.
The quality is the same as at other Vapiano restaurants, but the waiting time is very long at peak times!
Good tea and delicious desserts.
On the downside, you'll have to wait a good 15 minutes for a table at snack time.
Artistic Asian cuisine with original cocktails and stylish decor.
Resa required for the evening.
‚ô• Super bar on the banks of the Canal Saint Martin.
The small terrace is pleasant and the interior delightfully vintage.
Reasonable prices in bobo land!
All you have to do is find a place for it :)
Very good burger, fries no more, not too expensive and hearty.
Preferably after 3pm to avoid queues.
Perfect service, very good food.
The cheesecake is disappointing (far from its traditional recipe) but the rest is worth the detour!
Best value in the neighborhood, with heated terrace in winter.
Often crowded, but a great Parisian HQ.
Better book ahead, long queues!
A rather atypical place.
The cocktails are classics revisited with sake, and they work well.
We haven't had a chance to try out the dishes yet, as we're always fully booked.
I'm not a big fan of lemon tart, but this one's a knockout!
The flan is also a real killer.
The only advantage, in my opinion, is that this brasserie is open all night and right in the center of Paris.
Otherwise very average quality even on the pig itself
It's good, but it's so long...
Eating and drinking in the 10th arrondissement
This is one of the best Japanese restaurants in Paris.
Don't be fooled by appearances...
The pizzas are much more authentic than the place!
Very good pizzas, but the management leaves something to be desired.
Very good coffee, about 5‚Ç¨.
Apple crumble + red fruit tea <3
It's getting worse and worse and taking longer and longer (queuing).
Add to that a deteriorating service, in short, it's not what it used to be!
R.I.P BIA
Very good and very affordable, plus a nice location.
The weekend bento is super fresh (the yuzu cream is to die for!) and the salmon bento is yummy.
You'll feel right at home here!
Simply gorgeous!
Great bar, pint at ‚Ç¨2.5 in HH (‚Ç¨4 normal), free couscous around 9pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays!
Best hot chocolate in Paris
Disgraceful service (the waiters would rather deal with empty tables than customers) + desserts 2 x smaller at the end of the service (but at the same price, of course)„Äì a place I wouldn't recommend!
I've tasted better waffles.
I found Meert's a little too buttery and sweet.
Great terrace very nice and low price! 5‚Ç¨50 cocktails all night!!!
*** Restaurant/ Plate Service / On Place - Specializing in burgers with a delicious bun, thick meat and cooked to perfection!
Come for the Pastrami and cheesecake too!
Service on the indoor terrace is non-existent.
If it's not the slowness, it's the waiter's lack of politeness and, if you still want more, the scam of the bill!
The boss stinks
I hear the sushi and maki are very good.
Service always very slow. Terrace not closed, so it's very cold...
asian-style fusion cuisine
chef's salad and roasted camembert!
The beef tartare and duck confit are very good.
20 cents a toilet for "friendly" customers!
Clearly one of the best bagles in Paris.
But the room is very small! 5.90‚Ç¨ per bag + drink.
For dessert: Oreo cake or Nutella bagle ;)
Daily specials and salads can be enjoyed on the terrace.
Prices are very reasonable for this pretty spot.
Well it's not great but prices are not excessive for the fields and open all night so +1
Fair trade coffee for connoisseurs of fine wines from around the world
No good mice running behind the bar
Escalope de veau √† la cr√®me aux champignon (veal cutlet with mushroom cream) is a great way to wait for the season for veal chops with chanterelle mushrooms ;-)
An atmosphere typical of the lively 20th century.
Superb salad in a very large, high-ceilinged venue.
Very friendly waiter, almost like being at home.
Very reasonable price for the quality.
The service is as unpleasant as it can be, and the menu is too long, which raises doubts about the freshness of the products.
Great food and cool staff
For fitters only.
Very nice place but avoid brunch, too little.
Cheese as thin as cigarette paper is not worth the 22‚Ç¨ better to take salads and quiches then by sweet
great cakes
I recommend the "Merveilleux chocolat" but don't plan to have dinner afterwards, it'll settle your stomach for 15 days!
a unique starter-main course-dessert restaurant.
Authentic Bobo atmosphere.
good and not very expensive. tried and tested sweet crepes. very friendly service.
The welsh with maroilles (meatless if you're vegetarian) is simply delicious.
The service is great!
We've had a nicer welcome, but the new autumn/winter menu is really quite good.
A special mention for the roast duck and the trio of cr√®mes br√ªl√©es!
Nice and quiet place to have a snack :) very good coffee and yummy homemade cakes
Equinox and fruit tarts are magical.
But say what you will: the best chocolate √©clairs in Paris are here.
The chocolatine (chocolate bread) is delicious, as is their sesame cheese roll
A marvel of a restaurant, pleasant service, delicious dishes, and in summer you can enjoy their inner courtyard.
Flavorful cuisine.
The service, on the other hand, is less pleasant
Don't forget the ratatouille, which is anything but Proven√ßal!
excellent, very tasty blends
Perfect for a short break, whether alone or with friends, to enjoy or work, extra style!
Noodles
Very pleasant setting, but mediocre cuisine and slow service.
More like a drink.
Red wine: take the Lascaux
Personal barman, giant fridge, wall of vinyl, red banquettes, burger smell...
Everything you need for brunch with friends or family.
white or milk hot chocolate is a must-try.
Excellent place for tourists looking for 1900s Paris.
Go to the one at Galeries Lafayettes, which is much cleaner
For me, Schwartz rhymes with pastrami, huge pastrami sandwich.
The rest is also very good, super copious and affordable.
Very good coffee, but the atmosphere is a bit of a prout-prout
Prefer the upstairs lounge!
Squeezed grapefruit is a delight!!!!
yumiiiiii everything's good... not much room though!
Quite expensive and the waiters are not very friendly.
Lemon meringue pie, on the other hand, is a must.
And the place is cosy!
Pretty good pizzas.
Very varied menu, with prices going up for the more sophisticated versions.
There are better pizzerias nearby.
Service is slow and very unpleasant.
The pastries may be good, but the bread is disappointing. You can find better baguettes for less
Takoyaki, fast service, delicious!
People too
Wide variety (and quality) of coffees: perfect for coffee lovers ‚ù§Ô∏è Service a little dry (weary tone & evasive advice).
Lactose-free options (so many plant milks!) would be appreciated
20-minute wait for 1 cappuccino and 1 espresso :/
Long long long! And the waiters aren't very friendly!
The biggest scandal in a long time!!!!
The portions are excessively expensive and inedible!
A very Parisian place for Parisians
Very friendly restaurant, delicious prawns and nothing to say about the service.
I'll be back, even if the price is a bit steep!
Good quality coffee, but the service doesn't keep up.
The lemon frappucino refrecha (with iced tea) isn't bad at all: it's a nice change from coffee in this springtime!
A very good menu, well worth the effort for a dinner for two or with friends.
Great value for money, in short, a really good time, I'd happily recommend it!
one of the best value for money in Paris.
Very fresh produce and a lovely garden.
Not good but not expensive
The waiters change every couple of days and are as bad and unpleasant as ever.
Delicious, hearty cheesecake.
I can't wait to come back and eat.
Noisy at weekends, rather small, but excellent food and very affordable prices.
Not bad for an Italian, but the "fast" cuisine needs to be reviewed, you don't have to be in a hurry.
But I love the concept of dishes made in front of our eyes and the pasta is good!
Soft bread almost like at Shake shack ;)
Mint tea on the terrace!
Expeditious service, a little too factory-like.
But the flammekueches are not bad
Hmmm, the entrec√¥te is great!
And the cafe gourmand, a real delight.
An authentic Parisian brasserie ;)
especially for desserts...
Philippe Starck decor, fast, friendly service and dishes that are out of the ordinary üëå
Unpleasant waitresses...
Good but overpriced for a quick meal
The caramel pear tatin is a real mouthful :-)
Escalope de beau montagnarde !!!
Sanduiche bourguignon!
The staff will have great difficulty serving you in less than an hour on any night of the week.
Nice for a drink.
Cool and relaxed.
Very nice and inexpensive bar, you can mess around with the waiters.
You can have plates of French fries for ‚Ç¨4.
A gem for the neighborhood
A place to be avoided at all costs.
Disgusting crepes worthy of frozen foods (which, by the way, are probably better) and obnoxious waitresses with zero customer relations skills!
Drink coffee and write in a cool atmosphere (:
From now on, roses are made of fabric...
I'd like to go there again!
Perfect for a trip to America!
No, no, no, too good an address to recommend!
Don't go there, you'll probably come back for sure, as much for the garden as for the varied menu and great prices, e.g. 11‚Ç¨ for a salad
Friendly waiters, but food a little stuffy
Come early, as it's very busy.
Brown tea is self-service
Sun at the end of the day
The lounge can be privatized for up to 18 people
New decor and attractive lighting.
Perfect for a lunch with friends
1day a Japanese woman was talking to me about the "best Gyozas and ramen".
Curious, I asked where (here).
There's a queue (ms partt) it's worth it!!!
Fat and tasty, so GOOD!

Fast, friendly service despite the crowds
Nice brasserie bar with good food!
Ask for Triple C, their tasting beer, and you're sure to have a great evening!
Huge lemon pie and very good cakes!
It's too expensive for a burger of this level.
Even if it's better than a MacDonald's
Watch out for the pigeon with the swollen leg...
He eats the muffin, not just the crumbs, and isn't afraid of anything!
Super cozy, makes you feel good...
The cucumber and basil cocktail is a real treat.
Very professional and welcoming staff!
Great value for a date or with friends :)
It's good, but I've had better.
And they're damn expensive, even for Paris.

Good pastries and good food.
The omelettes are very good :)
The crepe suzette is excellent.
We've been going to this restaurant for years, but this time we were very disappointed with the fillet.

Lovely, cosy surroundings, good cocktails (approx. 12 euros) and friendly service!

Nothing at all is good here in this starbuck
And it's not free !!!
Fast service for excellent galettes.
A very busy place, it's not uncommon to queue in front of it.
The space inside is optimized to satisfy as many people as possible.
the best! especially the bobune! to try and above all very affordable.
Please note: they do not take cb or TR
The great classic: the waffle.
Best in the world!
A very pretty set!
And a really good sheese cake!
I don't put it in my top 5 but it's 6th ^^ mouahahah very good !I recommend :)
The mille feuille and the chocolate artisan ... omg
Good burgers, much less fatty than those found elsewhere.
The fries are fine and very good, and the prices are the same as Macdo's, so it's a good substitute!
The lemon meringue tart is just incredible.
I find this bar near my home, and nicely decorated, the service is not very friendly and it's a bit of a factory!
A killer creperie!
Very good pastries but the service is a bit cold
If there's only one Sunday brunch in Paris, it's at Breakfast in America...but you'll have to get there early, before 11am!

But nice staff.
It's great to enjoy a delicious dessert in this atmosphere!
Extra for breakfast and best squeezed orange in the world ah!
A very warm welcome in a pleasant, if a little noisy, location.
The burgers are delicious and huge: it took me nearly an hour to finish mine!
Great Thai restaurant in Belleville.
Everything is good, the menu is very complete, the service is cool.

Come in summer to enjoy the garden.
The rest of the time it's cool.
Good place for a drink, a snack or a meal.
Enjoy the terrace as soon as the sun comes out.
Very very very good cakes!
(Chocolate pear crumble, a delight!!)
Good burgers and the cheddar fries are not bad at all :)
Very nice atmosphere and attentive staff, but the cocktails are really disgusting!

Free Couscous on Thursday night!
Soup (tomato basil in February) is really delicious.
Home-made, and served hot: the only regret is that it's not in keeping with the season!üçÖ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Really, really good ramen.
Miso is more than gourmet.
Tip: ask to adjust it with broth to lighten it.
Perfect Gyozas!
Asian fast food: fast, good and cheap!
The restaurant is divided in two, with the smaller room often having more space than the larger one.

The steamed specialties are good and the coconut pearls very soft.
Escargots, Escalope montagnarde, g√¢teau basque :) Top !!!

I was there yesterday, and they didn't have any
It closed :(
A cheap and really good Indian super.
Nan is made to order in the traditional way.
And choice vegetarian dishes.
For a quick lunch in the Montorgueil district.
A well-preserved, old-fashioned atmosphere, but very touristy and the quality of the pastries is very average (what a disappointment this Mont-Blanc is!)
Tiny, unassuming restaurant, but fast, friendly service.
Expect an unusual ramen, rich in flavour but also very fatty!
I recommend the "lean" broth
Hearty dishes and not at all expensive.
They're good.
On the other hand, it seems a bit greasy (too many sauces, too much soil), recommended for groups as there is plenty of room
An authentic Japanese restaurant with impeccable freshness!
American bagels!
Montblanc raspberry: üëçüèª
Delicious salmon skin makis!
The free glass of wine is available exclusively on the 1st Tuesday of each month.

Long and unpleasant staff.

lille's legendary waffles
The lemon meringue tart is a must, but it's giant.

The terrace and friendly service

Pizza for kids 3.5‚Ç¨ is great, it's hearty and it's fresh!
VERY nice service, but still running in (first week!), the place is very nice
Excellent cuisine, impeccable service, 20-30 euros per evening for main course and dessert.
The place is very charming, the wait a little long but we forgive them for the magnificent lemon tart and the choice of delicious teas!
A delicious espresso on the terrace overlooking the Grand Place: well worth the detour!
Excellent green tea tiramisu, green tea cake and green tea rolls!
And lots of bentos #miam
I've never been confronted with such a deplorable service as I am today...
I'm a regular here, but I know I won't be coming back again.
Expeditious placement attempt, no friendliness.
Nice but way too expensive!
I say, "the best lemon tart in the world!!!"
Enjoy Happy Hours here on May 21, 22 and 23 with roasted cauliflower, hazelnut and nuoc mam sauce from 6 to 8 p.m
Nice for a drink, a little expensive for dinner
Waiters could be retrained as prison guards
Very, very good scallops with salad.
The desserts seem to live up to the restaurant's reputation, but that's for another time...
Nice restaurant, good service and nice menu.
There's also a delicatessen just across the road, full of great products and a wine cellar.
Don't understand the hype.
Get lost, there's nothing to see.
The waitresses in mini-skirts are somewhat ridiculous, but the prices are beyond belief.
A restaurant completely at odds with the spirit of the Aligre district.
Really cool, but watch your stuff on the terrace: repeated thefts in summer 2012.
Relaxed atmosphere, cool music, great cocktails ... a first-class bar
1 euro coffee at the counter.
Unable to host 4sqDay.
Prefer La Terrasse!
A cosy place, but too crowded, the desserts are good, but the prices are too high.
Between cousins!
Yes, yes, family ... :-)
I celebrated my birthday there, the place is nice and the drinks aren't expensive, but the downstairs room smelled bad...
The only place to buy freshly roasted coffee in Lille
Nice setting, not a bad meal, but unbearable waiter.
The technic?
Be even more undrinkable.
It has the merit of reframing them.
Otherwise very good cheesecake, avoid the 1000 sheets.
a 1-hour wait, and prices promising quality, when in fact the food is rather low-end.
I'll remember the lousy 5.50‚Ç¨ √©clair!
Fortunately, the service is ok...
Be patient because it's always bulletproof =_=
c good, but it doesn't break 3 legs.
The place, eroded by crowds of tourists and a rather high average age...
Jeun's go your way.
The rest of you try another Angelina.
Very good service and good continental breakfast at ‚Ç¨36.

Minus: the proximity of the tables.
Burgers to die for.
Nice, reasonable price, excellent entrecote ;)
Nice Korean restaurant.
The best dish on the menu is bulgogi.
It's especially worth coming for their super-economical breakfast menu.
very nice and friendly, they make you feel at ease .a must try
Like all "trendy" places in the capital, patience is required before entering the premises!
But it will be rewarded x10!
One of the best tea rooms I've ever tried
If you want to let people know it's your birthday, this is the restaurant for you!
After trying the pasta all'arrabiata (a delight) I tried the bruschetta: not bad but I've seen better, not crispy enough for my taste and the soups are super good, ideal for winter
The hot chocolate is a little too "creamy".
Frankly, there's nothing exceptional about it: the cheeseburgers are dry, the fries are frozen, but that's all right, and the nachos are quick, so there's no point in waiting in line for them
The famous American "In and Out"... But French.
Incredibly slow service, but their products are so good!
Brunch fan, ideal for detoxing after the weekend's excesses!
The baguette and viennoiseries are really delicious.

0.20 ‚Ç¨ for a toilet and 4.30 ‚Ç¨ for a pepsi.
More expensive.
Only 2 liters of SP 98!
Best value for money for a Thai.
There are better ones out there, but they're usually much more expensive.
Between Japan and Brazil, there's the Rue de Paradis.
Try the bentos of the day, a sure bet.
Relaxed atmosphere, pleasant music, cocktail extra ... vagant, not to be missed
Welsh with maroilles excellent!!!
Always a 20-30 min wait, but the result is great burgers like nowhere else in Paris!
A magnificent garden perfect for taking a break from the hustle and bustle of Paris.
It's a shame we can't make reservations, but that's the price of success!
Come early in the evening.
Good classics, a little expensive but well prepared.
Nice terrace, OK service.
NB: the red fruit Pavlova, the jar of chocolate mousse and the great fries :) a little disappointed by the lemon tart.
2h15 in line for a Burger...
Not only is this restaurant really nice (I love the setting) and well located, it's also really good!
Special mention for the barbapapa dessert: deliciously regressive;
The macaroons are quite good, if a little expensive ...
A restaurant that really comes into its own, with a plant-based decor overlooked by a mezzanine to continue the evening.
The food is not bad and the cocktails are good.
Not bad at all on the plate and very nice space.
The seafood platter is decent, but not as good as at Dome or Dorr.
The finest sushi in Paris for those willing to pay the price.
Excellent coffee, passionate service, a tasteful place to visit in Paris.
In the heart of Lille, an authentic patisserie offering delicious waffles...
The coffee is good and comes from all over the world.
Beware of very long waits on weekends for your drink.
Excellent patisserie and very pleasant staff!
It's become very bobo, so the place has lost a little (a lot) of its authenticity, but it's still a nice address in the Faubourg Saint Denis.
Our friend Lignac has a tightrope and a long line.
The mandarin chestnut log is fresh and addictive.
Beautifully crafted right down to the packaging.
Good service, good food and good wine.
I feel at ease every time I'm here.
Excellent burgers and fries, but still a bit expensive for the ingredients used
Perhaps the best cr√™perie in Montparnasse, it's always packed with Parisians and tourists: you have to wait to get a seat, but "is worthwhile"!
Duck barbecue always a treat
The best on Rue St Anne and the best Q/P ratio!
The waitresses are super nice
Oyster/cocktail bar opened by New Yorkers Candelaria and Glass.
Very nice place, unfortunately a bit overrated and too expensive.
The burgers are good, but I'm not a fan of their fries.
The food truck is next to a cinema and a library and, victim of its own success, you can't complain about waiting a bit sometimes.
Good value for money, very good reception, good plates well garnished!
Damned!
It's excellent but they don't take the CB!!!!
For a drink on the terrace overlooking the Canal Saint-Martin.
Club chairs, a relaxed atmosphere, lots of Anglo-Saxons and, above all, excellent coffee!
Scamming everyone to get in and eat buttery, buttery crepes that taste like butter and salidoux :D
I want to sink into the cushions for brunch on a Sunday
Delicious dummoriers and morizios.
Great Creation cocktails.
The outdoor terrace is a real delight in fine weather.
The ladies' salad is a great value (15 euros).
My new favorite cr√™perie!
Come early if you don't want to queue.
A pleasant caf√© with Swedish-style decor (anything else would be an understatement).
We come here for the large outdoor terrace.
One of the best addresses in town!
The dishes are very light and not great, the bill is a bit steep but the setting is rather exceptional.
It's a shame, the burgers are uneven from one day to the next.
One minute they're delicious, the next they're not...
At least the mustards are delicious.
I'm starting to get fed up with the noise, the very lively and uncourteous clientele, the lack of space...
But I must say that the lamb kebab is really worth it
A must-see in Lille, rather like Laduree in Paris.
Chic.
A good address for a tasty brunch at an affordable price (‚Ç¨25); the dining room is sumptuous, and the terraces are the place to be when the sun is shining! (reservations recommended)
A delicious collection of macaroons with great seasonal flavours!
Never order snapper!!!
Over 100 pizzas on the menu!
Service a little long at lunchtime, but the staff are very pleasant and the food is well worth it!

All excellent!
Very, very pretty...

Qui va piano va sano.
Here, it's best to take your time.
No catering professionals to serve you, no doubt
Respect for values: solidarity, traceability and quality for an exceptional coffee ‚òïÔ∏è
Nice place to drink a good coffee and chat or read a book
No happy hour, but the pint is ‚Ç¨5.
Disappointing welcome.
Pushed towards the exit well before closing.
Aging frame

Fashionable, bobo, lots of people.
Nice for a beer.
Fast and pleasant service, good, cheap/
an original and sympathetic tearoom like few others in Paris.
Service, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired...
To reserve a table, please arrive before 12.15pm
Incredible food and friendly service.
Original but delicious pizzas ;)
Be careful, the Chili Cheese Fries, presented as side orders, make a whole meal for a standard European appetite ;-)
But beware of the "African" hot chocolate, which is super chocolaty!
Take this or a pastry, but not both!
This little pleasure is priceless!
Open until 8pm, bakery and pastry shop!
Great service and great burgers: a Parisian must!
Immediate propulsion on the North Atlantic coast!
A cool bar for a change of scene!
Good wines and great tapas!

Rice noodle soup with Peking duck!
The breakfast is not very good (especially the cakes)- prefer Ladur√©e
