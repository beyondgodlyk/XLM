Super Bock (beer): ‚Ç¨3
CUPID - VALENTINE's night deal: from Friday 14 to Saturday 15 February 2014 CHF 280.00 for two including: Aperitif ‚Äì Dinner ‚Äì Double-room Accommodation ‚Äì Breakfast.
Nice place but a bit expensive for what it has to offer‚Ä¶
My first visit to Akatsuki in a long time, the prices have gone up, the quality's not what it used to be but the place is still as nice.
The delivery was fast but it took hours on the phone for them to understand what my address was (only 500 m away).
If you can't decide which pizza to order, go for the Rialto!
The staff is really nice but the burgers could be nicer!
It's a shame that nice burger restaurants are so rare.
The type of restaurant where you pay a fortune for three bits of carrots on your plate.
Ideal for happy hour or for an evening out with friends, 30 seconds away from Champs-Elys√©es.
Excellent, very welcoming, I'm a fan.
You come here to eat the dish of day, you come back one evening or in the summer to sit on the terrace.
Some of Montreal's best croissants, the nicest in the neighboorhood.
The soft chocolate cake.
Smoked salmon pancake, apple and chocolate pancake, cider.
Excellent meal, fast service, friendly staff, decent prices.
Very average, the staff is not very friendly, the conveyor belt is very slow‚Ä¶
There's a great choice of beer on tap, but they should really use different baps for the burgers, they're far too dry at the moment.
In the middle of nowhere, the Amigo Caf√© welcomes you as if you were life-long friends.
A typical meal, rich and filling.
The Navajo Taco is amazing.
<NAME> and <NAME>, the owners, are really cool, so is their dad; relaxed family atmosphere.
All the students from St Hyppo have been here at least once!
The meal was delicious but the service was rubbish, we had to wait 25 minutes for the bill.
The grilled rib-eye steak.
Best seafood restaurant of the dock.
Here, the fish is fresh and the service is worthy of the Tr√©port :o)
A truly traditional brasserie ‚Äì fixed in the past.
Small unpretentious pizza place, classic d√©cor, delicious thin-dough pizza, very reasonable prices, nice and easy after the cinema.
Fast service, polite staff, generous portions of fries and very good chicken!!
Good value for money but nothing to sing and dance about.
It's dirty, the food is inedible, there are non-stop Arabic videos on the screen.
It's one of the worst Asian restaurant in Tunis.
The best 'couque' butter biscuits in Brussels.
The atmosphere is fab and the service great (well, the waitress brought the wrong burger). The burger is not so good, the bread is dry and so is the meat.
For half the price you can get a hot dog from the Mansart and it's ten times nicer‚Ä¶
Very welcoming restaurant for a successful aperitif and game of p√©tanque.
This caf√© first opened in 1886 and it hasn't lost its charm‚Ä¶ a very good place!
Always open, the service is always great, it's always tasty, even if it's a bit expensive.
Delivery of ready meals.
Great restaurant, the rib-eye steak is excellent, so is the "pierrade".
And you're not hungry anymore after that. :)
Fast service, original selection, the carrot, orange and coriander salad is very good.
Everything is well planned at La Popote, the happy hour on rainy days, the fab homemade fries on Thursdays, the make-yourself-at-home soup in winter‚Ä¶
A really good place (the burger is top-notch but so is everything else)
This restaurant is so good and OMG the coffee!
A nice surprise. Very tasty burgers despite the pre-cooked bread.
Fairly good selection of burgers and it seems you can pre-order by phone.
Only downside: the premises are too small.
Expensive, the quality of some of the basic ingredients are not great for a restaurant that calls itself "Butcher".
Not to mention the owner who can be extremely unpleasant with his customers. What a shame‚Ä¶
Restaurant-Grill in a great location!
The food is really good too!!!
It's well worth the detour!!
Very disappointed by the pancake place, supposedly creative but fairly hard to digest.
Nice little caf√© that serves very good sandwiches.
The d√©cor is nice, it feels like home!
One of Disneyland Paris' best restaurant: I recommend it.
Excellent pizzeria with a friendly and very accommodating owner.
Very friendly atmosphere, an outgoing owner, healthy and tasty food.
I recommend the Tetouan, it's amazing.
Nice setting, but the pizzas are really too greasy‚Ä¶
Having to repeat my order three times, that's a bit much really‚Ä¶
The lady's really not friendly; if she turned the radio down, she'd hear the orders better‚Ä¶
The meat dumplings are indeed excellent.
Watch out though: the sweet potato soup contains no sweet potatoes and the cheesecake is just a very average yoghurt cake.
Best value for money pizza.
The Thai food is really nice.
However, I'd advise to stick with the Thai food (especially if you order fish!)
The Peking duck was a real disappointment‚Ä¶
Rather disappointed.
I thought it could replace the KFC, but it really can't.
Everything is overcooked, the pine nuts are too dry, and so is the chicken. The fries are no salty enough‚Ä¶ that's a shame, next time I'll stick with the original.
The steak and reblochon sandwich is simply de-li-cious!
Probably the best value for money in town.
Honestly, there are a KFC and a Quick round the corner.
This McDonald's is dirty, there's often something missing from the order and the food is cold.
In short, not worth stopping here.
Nothing to rave about really.
The daily specials were just ok and the toilets stank of shit.
Good choice for lunch!
Now that it's more popular, the quality of the service has gone down.
It's relatively good value for money but just about.
The salads are not fresh, the toasts are not toasted properly, it's sillily expensive. The topless girls sitting on the deckchairs might just be there to attract the customers.
Don't take the bait.
If there are 5 or more of you, you're considered as a group and you don't have a choice but to order the ‚Ç¨20.90 set menu.
This set menu is really not worth the money.
The service could be improved too.
Best tacos I've ever had :-)
The soup is really filling.
Yes, quick service‚Ä¶ especially when you order from the drive.
The ‚Ç¨12.50 all-you-can-eat buffet is very nice.
Quiet atmosphere, simple d√©cor and friendly place.
Very good value for money, especially in this neighbourhood. Worth a try!
Small fruit and veg shop.
Some of the fruit and veg is organic.
Limited selection but you can usually find the basics.
A great Chinese restaurant.
I go there at least once a month.
Enormous salads and two terraces.
The pizzas are absolutely delicious!
Tasty chicken! :D
Always fresh and excellent!
The best galette is the "baragouineuse" which comes with scallops.
This chapatti is not a specialty from Nabeul, it comes from Mahdia.
Nice experience for children, even if the cooks are not very familiar with traditional recipes.
Check the bill before you pay!
Make sure you count yourself!
Pretty 1930s brasserie, quieter and less trendy that the other caf√©s on rue Vieille du Temple.
Nice open sandwiches.
Ask for chocolate in the cone and try the carambar and candy floss flavours. Delicious!
Excellent restaurant in a magnificent setting, very interesting menu and flawless service.
Li√®ge Waffle
Rubbish music for deaf people, consider yourself warned!
Choose one of the salads, the sixth one is delicious! üòªüòç If you want to go somewhere trendy, go to La Terre Allant Vert!üòÅüëçüëå
Quality restaurant. At lunchtime, the dish of the day costs ‚Ç¨12. Allow around ‚Ç¨20 if you order √† la carte.
A caf√© in Montreal.
Very pleasant local brasserie.
The owners will welcome you like family!
My suggestion: the cheeseburger with cantal cheese ‚Äì delicious!
From 16 to 22 September, the P√®re Fouettard is taking part in the RESTAURANTS FOR ALL initiative ‚Äì ‚Ç¨40 set menu with salmon tartare, espuma wasabi, suckling pig with honey glaze, giant Profiterole, traditional hot chocolate.
The best restaurant in Station Alexandre, 13014!
Don't go there, it's dreadful!
‚Ç¨8 for a salad ‚Äì what a joke!
They have everything you need to get completely full!
You eat well for a reasonable price!
You have to feel like dining under a spider web #halloween is over, now it's #christmas
They have very cheap sandwiches! Around CHF4 or CHF5.50.
Not a bad Thai restaurant, the buffet is great too ;)
I took a couscous and the fish they had was far from being fresh. The service was really rubbish, the cutlery was dirty and the glasses chipped.
I've only been her once and I had mussels. They were not the worse I'd ever had but not great. Very limited selection of mussels and beer‚Ä¶ Disappointing!
I've really enjoyed visiting the wonderful region, it's very authentic, grounded and very generous. Well done!!
I strongly recommend it to those who love nature and authenticity.
The sweet and savoury tarts are delicious.
Proxi is like Aladdin's cave, you'll find all the treasures you might wish for.
The fresh eggs are mixed with semi-skimmed milk that princes would dream about bathing in ;-)
Reasonable price and decent hygiene for this part of Tunis.
Try the seafood ojja.
Watch out: it's a big portion.
Since you're at Softy's, I recommend the steak tartare and fries or the meatballs with tomato sauce.
What you'd expect foodwise‚Ä¶
But not always welcoming and dreadful service‚Ä¶
Depending on the waiters/who‚Äôs at the till‚Ä¶
You sometimes get a smile or a snappy remark‚Ä¶ But‚Ä¶
You have to admit that it's very convenient as it's just opposite the cinema‚Ä¶
Unpretentious brunch menu, friendly helpful staff, a good place for a chat.
Very bright for breakfast in the morning.
The best ice cream in Vietnam!
Nice place, as always with Hooters.
Pleasant little terrace, and lots of space for large groups in the basement.
I advise anybody going to Zibo's to order a glass of Heineken, the duck confit and the Cajun blackened chicken breast!!!
The taramasalata made in Greece and amazingly fresh dolmades.
Tapas 2.0
Best pizzas in Li√®ge.
They offer full meals, vegetarian or not, mostly made with organic ingredients.
And I very much enjoyed what I ate there.
Get the almond pain au chocolat.
The pork knuckle is the iconic dish of Le Commerce‚Ä¶
Very expensive and totally uninteresting.
From Tuesday to Friday: 12-5 p.m.; Saturday: 12-6 p.m. in beautiful premises.
A seriously great treat, the service is flawless.
Saut√©ed beef with basil.
The owner is a complete idiot‚Ä¶
If you see this restaurant, just walk on!
It‚Äôs was absolutely delicious, I recommend the salmon sushi.
Charming restaurant owners offering fine food in pleasant premises.
The "caf√© gourmand" is very filling!
Very welcoming, friendly waiter, fairly basic menu, decent but nothing special, average value for money.
Very pleasant lounge atmosphere!
Don't forget to choose the beer that goes best with your burger than to their colour coding!
Great place, great meat.
The soy ramen and the gyosas are excellent.
OMG the staff is really unfriendly and useless.
It's not getting any better.
Don't go there if you want to go skiing in the afternoon.
Check the bill too.
Decent food and pleasant service.
Just one piece of advice: try the French toast.
Very busy at lunchtime but the staff are not messing about.
You absolutely have to try: the cheese croquette sandwich and the meatball sandwich.
Made with Blue Chimay and authentic Li√®ge syrup!
Very nice concept.
Very good value set menus.
Free Wi-Fi.
There's a free loyalty card.
It means you can get free drinks, desserts or boxes‚Ä¶
Except the people at the till tend to "forget" to offer it to you!
Very classic and convenient.
The caramel Coretto is perfect!
Perfect place for Val's birthday!
Tip of the day: Time Square burger (seasoned beef, real cheddar, emmental, salad, onions, cheese sauce)
Good and air-conditioned unlike the one on the coast.
The food is good but the service is really slow.
Absolutely charming place and staff.
Good food, fairly refined.
The dishes are tasty and nicely prepared, a bit expensive though!
Perfect for a business meal or a date!
The bagels come with plenty of fillings and quality ingredients.
The 2 bagel offer is great (1 savoury bagel+1 sweet bagel+a drink).
I don't recommend the peanut butter bagel.
Without a doubt the best Thai restaurant in Montpellier!
Rib-eye steak and fries every Friday!!
Very welcoming, great staff!!!
Very filling and very tasty crunchy roll.
The fish gratin is quite simply delicious :D As an afternoon snack or for dessert, have the molten chocolate cake.
Good food (homemade open sandwiches, wraps, burgers) and the staff is always friendly!
You simply have to order the cannelloni, they're amazing.
The coffee is excellent. The place has received various barista awards!
Wi-Fi area if you want to do some work, small place but very inspiring.
Very good! But the prices keep going up :(
Excellent cuisine despite <NAME>'s departure. He seems to still be monitoring the creativity and the flawless quality of the dishes.
The service is still as pleasant and professional.
The best mussels in Koksijde!
The mixed platter looks very good and it's delicious.
Very good, pleasant setting (opposite the Victor Hugo hotel).
We each ordered the lemon sole, followed by a rum baba and Saint Marcellin cheese.
Good selection, natural ingredients.
Shabby chic atmosphere.
Relaxed services.
The bisquits are fab.
Great atmosphere on Thursday nights!
Teatime with a raisin, cinnamon and orange peel pastry.
Still as charming and tasty as it was a year ago when we started coming here!
15 minutes before they took our order‚Ä¶
Smallish but tasty burgers, no meal deals at the weekend, no XL steak option.
In the end, a bit pricy compared to Frog or Big Fernand.
You have to like brioche bread.
Sweet potato chips‚Ä¶
Hummm!
Delicious!
The burgers are admittedly a bit small, but very tasty.
Very friendly waitresses.
A very good place for burgers.
Everything is homemade, excellent value for money.
The cheesy is delicious!
Not to mention the chips!
Excellent service, nice beer, tasty burgers!
Only downside, the size of the burgers‚Ä¶
The service is a bit slow, the burgers are fairly good but a bit pricey.
A hipster joint.
Very very tasty burger.
I went along with no major expectations (I was in the neighbourhood and I'd heard about the place): it was delicious and I'll definitely go back.
Delicious, quality food, but very busy.
The "signature" is very good! :-)
A trendy burger place!
Allow ‚Ç¨10 without chips‚Ä¶
And the setting is not particularly pleasant, you eat your food but you don't stick around!
Disappointing.
Very friendly service but the burgers are really basic.
I tried the "Melt": the meat was ok, but it was pretty tasteless and there wasn't enough salad.
15 euros for a very average burger/chips, that's a bit much.
Most certainly the best burgers in Paris, the menu is updated daily.
Don't hesitate to visit one of the other three outlets if this one is too crowded, they're equally nice!
Nice burgers.
But very busy.
Everything is nice!
Gourmet burgers and reasonable prices.
Nice combination of flavours.
Not bad considering it serves 100% homemade food!
A cool food-truck-style restaurant, unpretentious. A very good place for burger fans.
The burgers are delicious, but what's really amazing is their garlic mayo.
There you go.
Very good burgers. The sweet potato chips aren't bad either. Worth a try :)
Very very tasty burger.
One of the best burger places in Paris.
The Cheesy classic is delicious.
Everything is homemade, including the ketchup.
Very friendly welcome!
The waitresses are friendly, but the burgers and the portions of chips are too small, you might need to order something else afterwards.
And before closing time, they had run out of coleslaw.
Disappointing.
The Bourget is alright but not amazing, and the chips are really not great‚Ä¶
The best chips I've ever had!
Friendly welcome, crispy chips, choose one of the little tables outside!!
A nice place but they could do with coat racks.
Not really impressed by the value for money‚Ä¶
Plus you have to wait for a long time‚Ä¶
I won't go back.
The burgers are amazing.
Best place in Paris alongside Big Fernand.
The sweet potato chips are excellent.
I tried the "Signature".
Excellent.
The portions of chips are decent and are good value for money, but the burger was definitely the best one I ever had.
The bun was to die for, the combination of flavours was great, and it was perfectly cooked.
The West burger is really tasty.
It's everything you want from a burger.
The sweet potato chips were equally good!
Avoid going there at the weekend, or at least make sure you go well after lunchtime/dinnertime or you might have to wait a long time.
Excellent buns and recipes!
Not too bad but not as good as it used to be‚Ä¶ :(
The cheesy is out of this world!
Top burgers.
Lots of extras, not too fatty.
I recommend the sweet potato chips and, for once, the cheesecake slices are not too big so they're a nice way to end the meal.
Positive points: bread, service, everything is homemade. Negative points: chips, not much salad in the burgers and tasteless meat, expensive.
The best burgers in my opinion!
The west is out of this world.
Perfect burgers: toasted brioche bun, nice meat and rich cheddar.
Fast service. +1 for the cheesy.
I recommend it.
Great burgers!!!
The meat and bread are top quality, the prices are reasonable and the place is welcoming.
Good service!
The burgers are as nice as ever.
A piece of advice: try the Signature :)
Very good burger, the bun is great and so is the meat, which is minced on the premises :)
There's a bit of everything.
Delicious burgers as well as tasteless ones.
I've never managed to get it right each time.
It's hit and miss. Good luck to you.
The homemade food is delicious and it‚Äôs very welcoming.
I'm in!
I really dug the Cheesy.
The barmen don't speak French.
A cool place, slightly loud when there's a match on, but not too expensive, with a view over la Villette's artificial lake and the vertical-lift bridge in rue de Crim√©e.
I recommend you pay this bar a visit, great atmosphere.
Not too bad for a drink and nibbles while watching a match, but that's about it.
Terrible burgers, chicken in the vegetarian quesadillas‚Ä¶ rubbish service.
Very disappointing.
Choose a spot on the tiny terrace along the canal, with a view over the vertical-lift bridge.
Very friendly staff.
Apparently the men's toilets are also worth a visit!
The drinks are too expensive: ‚Ç¨7 for a pint of beer.
‚Ç¨8 for a medium mojito.
We had to wait 25 minutes to get a platter of chicken wings.
Very nice atmosphere and reasonable prices.
Avoid the toilets if you're hypochondriac.
A very nice place with a nice view.
Nice little bar, nice youth-hostel and local atmosphere which is hard to find in this neighbourhood.
A very pleasant view over the canal, a very eclectic Belushi's atmosphere, just the way we like it.
Try the French Plancha!
You simply have to try the Hawaiian burger!
Very friendly atmosphere, lots of English speakers.
Decent burgers and reasonably priced drinks.
Very nice setting if you sit outside on the terrace, just by the canal.
Apart from that, nothing special: it's just a bar next to a youth hostel and it's all a bit shabby.
The portions are generous and cheap.
The selection of beer is nice too.
And the atmosphere is very eclectic and friendly.
The buffet is a classic, but if it's not your thing, you can go to the Comptoir on the ground floor, it‚Äôs amazing.
Everything is so nice and really affordable given the quantity you get!
Try it!
Good selection but expensive!
The potato salad is mad!
And if you want peace and quiet, the stone-walled basement is very pleasant!
The veggie chili and the Greek-style tofu are delicious!
A nice reception room in the basement.
The dinner is slightly more expensive than lunch.
Resto V√©go is a buffet which offers lots of vegetarian and healthy options (a few vegan ones too).
Try it to sample the possibilities that a plant-based diet offers!
Students get 10% off.
Interesting to only find that out at the end of the year when I've been here dozens of time over the last few months!
Delicious.
A great selection of fresh vegetables and salads.
A great selection of desserts and hot dishes.
The fast food counter is average.
Perfect for a working lunch, on your own or with your team.
At that price, you really need to lick off your plate (but thanks for the 10% student discount all the same)
Excellent vegan and vegetarian restaurant in Montreal (just like in a food market, you pay for your food according to the weight).
The vegan dishes are clearly labelled. #Vegan #2Bvegan4
Some excellent dessert available from the buffet, including some vegan options.
A good selection of healthy vegetarian sandwiches on the ground floor.
The steak is served very rare!
It‚Äôs a bit like the vegetarian Flunch in Montreal.
Very nice.
Sunny terrace and room.
Brunch and classic lunch menu.
Very good burgers.
I go there at least once a week with my work colleagues.
Try the bun's, medium rare!
Perfect for a Sunday brunch!
The bun's is very nice and the homemade mayo served with the chips is a nice bonus!
A caf√© that mostly serves (fairly average) burgers.
Pleasant in the evening.
The neighbourhood HQ if you want to have a nice time.
Reasonably prices, quality food.
The Australian wine is a must.
The terrace is perfect for a pre-dinner drink.
The dishes are simple but very tasty!
Delicious burgers, generous portions, very friendly waitresses.
Spending the evening on the terrace of Caf√© Cr√®me is extremely pleasant.
Nice affordable brunch.
The staff is friendly.
Not expensive for this neighbourhood and friendly service.
My HQ!
The vegetarian bun is great.
You should also try the Caesar salad.
Good value for money for this neighbourhood.
And, importantly, the staff is very friendly.
A hair in my eggs benedict, a supposedly clean glass with lipstick marks, a section of the dish which is completely cold...
What can I say‚Ä¶
The ‚Ç¨10 bun is really nice and the waitress is lovely.
Great cobb salad for ‚Ç¨12.
The bun's is delicious, so are the Sauvignon and the cocktails, the prices are more reasonable than in other places in the neighbourhood and Suzanna is the best waitress in the world!
A cheap afternoon snack!
You can have a coffee or a hot chocolate with a cake or pastry in a very pleasant setting.
Very disappointed.
The burgers and chips are very average and greasy!
Things are not what they used to be‚Ä¶
Bring back the previous chef!
Nice brunch, cheap.
The staff are friendly.
Very friendly service!
Unpleasant service!
Very nice meat and desserts.
All you'd need would be a smile from the waiters and it would be perfect!
Very average service.
Inedible Fish'n'chips, hard as a rock, straight from the freezer to the fryer.
Seriously, is this what you call a restaurant?
Very disappointed‚Ä¶ the waiters are full of energy but they keep running around, the room is incredibly noisy and the food is really disappointing.
Feels like a trap for hipsters.
The dishes are served cold and everything is rushed‚Ä¶
Excellent "caf√© gourmand".
Very friendly staff.
I didn‚Äôt like the attitude of the staff at all.
I don't understand why they treat customers like this.
Only for the Muffins burger and the chocolate and banana tart.
Decent value for money, generous portions.
Soy marinated chicken and rice for ‚Ç¨14.
Excellent brunch at the weekend, great breakfast set menu for ‚Ç¨6 in the week, delicious veggie burger!
For a drink or for supper, an unmissable Parisian brasserie near the Carreau du Temple!
On top of everything, the waiters are really nice and the prices are affordable!
Cosy and friendly!
Ideal for a drink and nibbles, followed by a burger!
The ‚Ç¨10 Muffin burger is well-known in the neighbourhood, no need to look at the menu!
One of my favourite places for the last three years!
Excellent platters and really good value!
Very very nice Cobb salad.
Very nice buns/burgers!
Average burgers (neither nice nor bad) but food poisoning the next day!!
I'll never go back!
Just opposite the Carreau du Temple so ideal for drinking a coffee while watching the crowd walk past.
Try the "granit√©s"!
They're delicious: two fresh fruit flavours with homemade cream on top.
OMG the best ice cream of my life! Be prepared for a long queue but it's so worth it!
One of the best known ice cream parlour in town.
A very large selection of flavours, not all as nice, but really worth the detour.
Excellent ice cream parlour.
A bit disappointed by the caramel ice cream.
Try the lemon one.
The best known ice cream parlour in Rome; an essential stop to sample unmissable ice creams!!!
Ask for whipped cream on top‚Ä¶ it's even nicer.
It's a bit hectic when you try and order but the ice cream is homemade and delicious.
Don't forget to ask for whipped cream on top :)
Very nice homemade ice cream and a great selection of flavours.
The tiramisu served in a little chocolate cup is delicious.
A great discovery: rice ice cream!
The paninis are very nice!
Typical and very busy!
Nice Italian ice cream but the Nutella one was too dense and too sweet.
Soulless service.
Amazing setting!!
Our evening was divine!
Thank you.
Say hello to the cat!
OK, so the cat is part of the deal‚Ä¶
Nice setting with a cosy atmosphere.
The staff is polite but the service is average and the bill is a bit stiff.
If you go to Caf√© RUC, don't forget to download the FLASHiZ app to pay with your mobile <URL>
A caf√© in the sun, opposite the Com√©die fran√ßaise‚Ä¶ the Opera‚Ä¶
Pleasant service.
Our evening was divine!
Thank you.
Ridiculously non-existent service, rubbish wine list, very average but very expensive food.
But the service has to be the worst: epic fail.
It looks beautiful from outside but the service OMG.
A rather chic setting.
A very nice Costes restaurant.
One of the best burgers too!!
Delicious and tender beef fillet steak served with homemade mashed potatoes, simply amazing!
Here's my advice: a glass of orange juice costs ‚Ç¨8.
Need I say more?
Very welcoming, great service. They altered my dish with any problems. And they have a cat and I love cats!
Simply perfect, from the moment you walk in to everything else.
A little glass of Champagne on a heated terrace!!
Just too beautiful, my love, happy birthday!
The cat for my daughter‚Ä¶
Simply delicious. The truffle risotto!!
And the fillet steak with pepper sauce!!
Love to you all!!!
The idea of mixing blue cheese and mustard is questionable.
Other than that, small but pleasant.
Very tasty.
I recommend it!
Watch out: the place is very small if you want to eat in ;)
Beer and burgers.
Very good burgers.
Get them delivered rather than eating in the restaurant (very few tables, small premises, toilets outside, plastic cutlery...).
‚Ç¨12 burger, fries and drink.
Very nice for the price, especially given the location.
French meat, vegetarian steak option.
The veggie burger is nice, perfect bun, and classic fries.
A good place for burgers and the staff is friendly > good job.
A very nice burger place which is exactly what this neighbourhood needed.
If you eat in, you'll have to go outside to go to the toilets.
Luckily, there's a sink you can use to wash your hands behind the counter.
Very small but not bad.
The combination of blue cheese and mustard is a bad idea though.
Great burgers with homemade chips, in a miniature restaurant.
‚Ç¨12 set menu.
It was very tasty, as nice as in the 18th arrondissement.
The service was fast and friendly.
Very nice concept with combines coffee time with art!
Very nice little garden‚Ä¶
The little garden at the back is great ‚Äì a lovely place worth discovering!
Excellent pastries and cakes, especially the passion fruit tart.
Very nice terrace, the place has a very industrial feel which gives it a lot of char. Designer shop on the first floor.
On the ground floor all the items are for sale.
An unusual place with an appealing design and a small garden well worth discovering!
The caf√© area is really trendy and if you like the furniture, you can buy it!
In the heart of the Marolles area.
A concept-store which offers clothes, objects, and bespoke furniture as well as a caf√©-restaurant.
The large terrace at the back is a great bonus.
Perfect for lounging‚Ä¶
A very stylish and spacious caf√©.
Industrial atmosphere: we love it!
A private garden hidden at the back of the gallery.
A fairly interesting menu, a nice atmosphere and a perfect place to relax.
Great place!!
The food is delicious and it's amazing to find such a quiet place in the heart of the city!!!
On the first floor, there's a great shop, called "Polo Polo" and run by a Spanish lady.
Nice selection of clothes, mostly made by Spanish designers.
Only downside: it's a bit pricey.
Great concept store with a nice terrace at the back.
On the first floor, a clothes shop for both men and women.
Worth a look!
Nice calm place, great d√©cor, perfect for a coffee break with friends.
Very exotic and very different!
A tasty supper with a view over the Seine!
Dinner in the restaurant along the Seine in Paris's 15th arrondissement: salmon fillet on a slice of aubergine which melt in the mouth and a glass of Chardonnay, mmmh !
34 euro brunch on Sundays: generous helpings (pastries followed by a main dish and dessert) and very tasty.
The service and clientele are a bit too formal (advertising and media crowd).
Great setting and amazing view, but the furniture is a bit old.
Great atmosphere, unique view, and to top it all, the dishes are excellent.
Great setting, very chic.
Very nice main dishes and desserts.
I love it!
Always!
Twice a week!
My favourite place to eat!!!!
Very nice terrace over the Seine, very decent menu, French gastronomy.
A wonderful view over the north side of the river, especially at night.
Appalling!
Utterly rubbish service, tasteless dishes (straight from a Picard shop) and the bill is way too high!
Avoid it at all costs!!
A very nice place: nice setting, delicious food and pleasant staff!
Very friendly service, perfect terrace.
There aren't many options on the menu but the dishes are very tasty.
‚Ç¨8 valet parking service
Always great whether with friends, on a date or with a work colleague‚Ä¶ the mojito is excellent‚Ä¶
So is the rest ;-)

Nice peaceful setting with a great view. The rest is very average though and not worth the prices which are a bit high.
Magnificent setting, large window panels overlooking the Seine.
The food is a bit tasteless (the ingredients aren't very good).
Beautiful terrace, a cosy and comfortable place opposite the Eiffel Tower and the made in France statue of Liberty.
Today, <NAME> from the Grand Journal is having lunch next to me.
How cool is that?!
Cosy atmosphere, friendly staff, in a nutshell a very good evening!!
Very nice setting, the cocktails are delicious.
Only downside is the price of the main courses‚Ä¶
Don't bother!
It‚Äôs total nonsense.
Appalling service and very disappointing brunch!
A wonderful view of the Eiffel tower.
The terrace overlooking the Seine is really nice.
Pleasant terrace, decent menu, booking facilities, valet parking service, booking ahead is recommended and be sure to arrive on time.
On Sunday mornings for brunch, the service is not really up to scratch‚Ä¶
It could do with some music.
But it's a really nice place.
Very pleasant Pic Saint Loup.
Excellent and fresh, even if the staff wasn't able to list the ingredients of the Yogi sauce‚Ä¶
The Falafusion was delicious and so was the carrot cakes!
Nice place for lunch.
Electric green smoothie (apples, spinach, parsley, almonds, dates and cocoa bean shavings).
Very satisfying!
The tempehtation is exquisite!!!
Really!
The sauce is wonderful!
The tempehtation is really excellent.
I didn‚Äôt like the chic kebab as much.
Falafels!
A must have!
I never I would eat this well in a vegetarian restaurant!
I had the falafel sandwich and a smoothie, and it really was excellent.
Fast and tasty, the salads are nice and filling.
They now serve organic beer.
Classic falafel.
$4.50
Excellent, could maybe do with a bit of spicy sauce.
Great vegan food.
Fast service, charming friendly staff, very affordable prices, fantastic falafels!
The peanut butter biscuit is the best one in the world.
For a drink or a quick snack such as tapas or mushroom omelettes.
Very expensive and dreadful service.
Nothing in common with the excellent Falstaff in Montparnasse and its amazing beer selection!
Very nice and very good location!
I don't recommend it!
The raspberry beer is delicious!
Decent food, but the room has no soul.
Very unpleasant waitresses.
I ordered Monbazillac and I was given Muscat.
Served in dirty glasses.
‚Ç¨5.90 a glass.
It's really not worth it.
If only we were given beer and a cosy open fire in church to warm up our souls, we would spend the day singing and praying without ever straying.
Apparently, the blond girl is a real bitch.
The cured ham platter is rather nice!
The blond waitress is a stupid bitch.
The evening waiter (a young black guy) is really unpleasant!
The blond waitress is larger than life.
The meal was perfectly nice but the waitress was fairly rude!!
<NAME> is a lovely waitress.
It's a nice atmosphere for a few drinks or a quick pizza.
Open until 5 am.
The waitresses are downright unpleasant!
Avoid this place!
Make sure you don't order the cr√®me caramel, it's inedible!
But the cr√®me br√ªl√©e is very nice!
Open until 4:30 am every night.
Typically unpleasant Parisian waiters.
Very good but the room is vey noisy!
I love this place.
Excellent Thai!
Great memories.
The brown beef curry with cashew nuts is delicious!
Nice but the room is particularly noisy.
Avoid it if you're out for a romantic dinner.
The food is very good, it‚Äôs somewhere between genuine Thai food and Thai food made for Europeans.
Fast service.
The restaurant is very noisy though.
Nice!
The crying tiger is worth a try!
Tried the pineapple and cashew nut duck = delicious!
Nice setting, good value for money.
Ideal for a Thai meal with friends ;-)
Very good, cheap, great d√©cor.
In my opinion the best Thai restaurant‚Ä¶
I concur, it's as noisy as it is tasty.
Friendly service.
Very good Thai restaurant!
The room is noisy, but the d√©cor is nice and the staff is lovely.
Good but not enough food on the plate.
Arrive early or book ahead!
They're so popular, it's hard to get a table at lunchtime.
Delicious!!
The best roast chicken in the world!!!
Eat it with your fingers!!!
I
am going there tomorrow. LOL
Kip flamb√©ed with Grand-Marnier :)
Best chicken in the world!!!
Extremely popular in Ostend; the chickens are delicious!!!
A must when you're in Ostend!
As delicious as ever!
The best roast chicken ever!
THE place to go when you go through Ostend‚Ä¶
Excellent chicken that you need to eat with your fingers, no chips, just bread, apple pur√©e and a few sauces - a real treat!
The chicken is simply delicious, eat it with your fingers with a bit of ketchup, mayonnaise or apple pur√©e.
Try it, you'll love it!
When your cooking goes wrong or you've ran out of food, it's quick and perfect!
Clean hands required!
A place you simply have to visit!
Nothing else than chicken on the menu; no chips, that's a shame.
Customer service could be improved if you compare it to other shops.
Great shop and clean free toilets!
<NAME>!!!!
Come and discover the biggest Nespresso shop in the world.
2000m2 of retail space.
An amazing place.
Entire walls covered with coffee capsules‚Ä¶
Wonderful place for a bloggers' discovery outing!
The 24/7 dispenser is ideal to grab a coffee after watching a movie.
Come and have a coffee on the terrace.
It's only just opened, make the most of it.
For those who work in the neighbourhood, the pick-up service is very fast!
Come and have a coffee on the terrace.
It's only just opened, make the most of it.
Very nice Fauchon sandwich.
Faultless service.
‚Ç¨50 cashback offered by Nespresso when you buy a machine with this voucher.
For those who are interested‚Ä¶
Come and have a coffee on the terrace.
It's only just opened.
Make the most of it.
A magnificent place, it's a shame you can't take photos!
Great service!
And very tasty!!
Ask <NAME> to look after you and you'll get great service with a smile ;-)
Beautiful view over the lake, great Italian-style welcome and good food.
It's become expensive for what it is :(
What can I say: in 5 years, I 've never been disappointed...
Always a safe bet.
Feels like a holiday, only a stone throw away from Brussels.
Idyllic setting, excellent food and pleasant staff.
What more can you ask for?
The pasta assortment is‚Ä¶ like a concerto, not great in terms of number of flavours (4), and the portions are very small (we had to order a pizza on top of the pasta). Came up to around ‚Ç¨30 without a starter or a dessert.
AVOID THIS PLACE!
Tasteless pizza, horrible owner, useless staff‚Ä¶
The setting is the only nice thing about it.
Unfortunately, this comment comes after a fair number of visits.
The food is very nice; in Summer, being on the terrace with a view over the lake is real bliss!
Very nice terrace by the lake.
Good pizzas.
5% off when you pay cash.
The unfriendly owner turned us down because "everything was booked" (when half the tables were free).
His loss.
A place we can forget about.
Probably the best pizzas in the area!
Very nice‚Ä¶ a bit expensive but what a view!
The best pizzas in Belgium.
First meal out on a terrace in Belgium this year.
Excellent authentic Italian cuisine in a magical setting by the water.
To make the most of the deals available at BioBurger, don't forget to show the loyalty card on your mobile via the FidMe app!
Go to the second floor.
It's a good idea, it's just a shame you can't choose how your meat is cooked.
The drinks and desserts are original, the staff is friendly.
Not much room between the tables in the restaurant.
Delicious and all the ingredients are organic, including the drinks!
What else could you ask for?
Good value meal deal: ‚Ç¨10 burger+drink.
Tasty organic burger + organic drink for ‚Ç¨10.50, great!
A bit disappointed by the cheeseburger, I was expecting cheddar rather than sickly greasy raclette cheese.
100% organic ingredients, all made in France.
Works out at ‚Ç¨10 for a meal deal or ‚Ç¨7 for a burger.
It's a bit bland.
A burger should be like a kebab ‚Äì greasy and dirty!
For once, all the burgers are available as a veggie option ‚Äì and they're nice!
Definitely tasty!
Best value for money!
The "pepper" is delicious, as always I go for the extra meat; the chips are delicious. Pleasant layout over two floors and friendly staff.
I love it!
100% organic.
You of course get the usual burgers but you can also get the veggie burger made of a tofu steak with tomato, salad, onions and ketchup.
‚Ç¨7 burgers.
Fast service, homemade fries and very nice burgers, all reasonably priced.
The burgers are delicious and there's a great selection of unusual drinks.
The "burger of the month" is nicely put together and original.
You're served really quickly and there's a great selection of unusual drinks.
It's nice, it‚Äôs tasty, it's cheap.
Don't hesitate!
Burgers.
Excellent!!!
Very welcoming. The quality of the ingredients is top notch!
Very good value for money.
It's tasty, it‚Äôs organic, unfortunately it's not very pretty ;) but it doesn't matter, you should still go there and support these young people full of good ideas. We're going to spread the word, guys... You deserve it! SY ASAP
The special editions are usually very nice, but the fries really aren't that great.
Good burgers for ‚Ç¨10 with fries and a drink.
The chips are also far to expensive.
The second floor room is a great place to chill.
Good cheap burgers.
All the burgers are available as a veggie option ‚Äì and they're good!
A good spot for a nice coffee among the locals.
Try the almond pains au chocolat!
Their tea is the best :-)
"Le p'tit printemps"
A maple delight!
The sandwiches are a bit expensive and not fantastic.
But I recommend their chai latte ‚Äì its delicious! ;) Free Wi-Fi ;)
You come here for coffee, you stay for the music and you come back for the grilled cheese.
The coffee is excellent, the atmosphere is great and the service is top notch. #GreatSpot
The iced coffee called "bayou" is really delicious and refreshing.
Best latte in town (with a little pattern on the foam!)
The best lattes in town!
The first tulips of the spring.
Best coffee in Quebec + free Wi-Fi + very good music.
Excellent coffee and great atmosphere.
One of the students' favourite hang-outs in the St Roch neighbourhood.
If you order an Americano, you'll get a double espresso.
Very good mocha!
Don't forget to ask for the Wi-Fi code.
Delicious latte, rubbish Wi-Fi!
A great spot to work, read or surf the net.
Nice coffee, nice food, pretty and friendly waitresses, very bright place.
If you don't like noise, avoid this place.
Watch out: they don't accept ApplePay.
The coffee is wonderful ‚Äì the atmosphere stimulates thoughts and creativity.
Excellent coffee, the latte is amazing!
It's a great place except if you‚Äôre in a hurry, there's only one till for all the orders.
Crazy!
If you want to be helpful and be nice to the staff, you can take your empty glasses/plates/etc. down to the counter.
They'll be grateful.
Lattes keep me alive!
The tables aren't always clean. The pastries are dry. There are flies around the counter in the summer.
The best latte ever!
Plenty of "easy listening"‚Ä¶
Luckily, there are nice people around and they know how to make good coffee.
The music has been a bit repetitive for a while.
Suggest some musicians!
The iced chai lattes are not brilliant.
Excellent coffee, excellent atmosphere!
The best steak tartare in Pau.
Everything is good.
The team is great.
The food is delicious.
One of Pau's best places.
The waiters are not very nice.
A must in Pau!
Delicious meal, but a long wait (not surprising given how busy it was).
They don't take bookings. Allow around ‚Ç¨20 per person.
You can't book ahead.
So go along at midday for the dish of the day and a slice of delicious tart. :)
Chateaubriand rossini, (you can order a half if you're not very hungry) or escalope guillonnette, followed by an iceberg sundae if you like Get 27!!
A very nice place!!
Salmon with b√©arnaise sauce.
You're served really quickly if you're lucky enough to get a table‚Ä¶ :-) great selection and, more importantly, the food is excellent!
The entrecote is wonderful.
A long wait and the food is drowned in sauce, not very sophisticated.
One of the best places in Pau.
The best "b√¢ton" and fish on boulevard des Pyr√©n√©es.
Nothing fancy, good ingredients and local customers (paper tablecloth, etc.).
Too expensive for you what you get; nice food but you don't get much of it, no side dishes (rubbish fries), overwhelmed and disorganised staff.
Horrible chips, overcooked sea bream, unpleasant waiter.
Never again.
A good steak with a b√©arnaise sauce, what else can you ask for?
The breakfast has a bit of everything. I fell in love with the white chocolate spread!
Such a nice welcome!
The waiters are so sweet.
Rather nice but the set menus are a bit basic for the price.
Great terrace and excellent iced tea.
Try the waffles!
Great!!!
Perfect!
The salads aren't very nice. They‚Äôre straight out of a plastic bag and not very fresh‚Ä¶
The brunch is very filling and very tasty!
Salad, yoghurt, bread and butter, juice, hot drink‚Ä¶ ‚Ç¨20 per person.
Watch out: it's very popular at the weekend!
For example: try the vanilla ice cream with a hint of sea salt.
You won't find any nicer desserts in town.
Cheap and pleasant, ideal to work with a nice cup of hot chocolate.
Perfect for brunch, with the family or with friends.
Great find, we'll go back, the staff are great, helpful and smiley!
We had a great time!
Antipasti for two, mushroom and truffle raviolis in chicken stock, delicious!
A proper Italian trattoria.
Delicious antipasti‚Ä¶
Rigatoni with aubergines‚Ä¶.. Yum‚Ä¶. You'll want to try everything!
Delicious.
It's a bit cold inside in winter.
Find a table as far from the door as possible.
Great, fantastic service and very good food to top it all!
A great place in the Boniface area in Ixelles.
Typical Italian fare.
Italian cuisine at its best: delicious antipasti, pasta, fish, veal etc. all prepared lovingly and served with a smile.
Great quality wine too.
Excellent, great service.
A real treat!
Excellent food, very friendly waiters and delicious house wine.
You'll definitely want to go back.
Complimentary glass of prosecco and nibbles when you get there.
Faultless service.
Great selection of Italian wine.
Excellent service, delicious food, great house wine ‚Äì a place to recommend!
The wine, the great selection of pasta and the antipasti.
Very welcoming. Just a piece of advice, avoid the table by the door, there's an unbearable draught and far too many people walking past.
Beef pasta.
You'll get a warm welcome.
Pre-meal drink and nibbles when you get there.
For 10 years, <NAME>, the owner's son at Aglio e Oglio, has been serving people with a smile.
Nibbles, aperitif, carpaccio and Limoncello on the house.
Don't forget to try the wine.
Excellent Italian restaurant, they don‚Äôt serve pizza and that's not a bad thing!
Don't hesitate to try it.
A place where you'll meet a lot of Italians who like sophisticated food!
The daily menu offers a wonderful selection of dishes from Tuscany.
Pasta, of course, but lots of other options too‚Ä¶
The rigatoni with aubergines are worth trying (so is the house wine).
Very good Italian food with a great selection of Italian wine.
The beef and truffle carpaccio is divine.
Excellent cakes, for example:
"le Puits d'amour"
The lemon tart.
Best rhubarb tart in the world!
Yummy avocado and chicken sandwich.
Bouch√©es √† la reine.
Luxury p√¢tisserie where customers get put down or even insulted (I heard a sulky waitress say: "looks like I'm a magnet for rubbish customers today".
Delicious rum baba though.
As far as I know, the oldest p√¢tisserie in Paris.
The Saint Honor√© is to die for.
Very surprised as the cakes and pastries are delicious and worthy of the most renowned places.
You can walk in with your eyes closed!
Iconic "Puits d'amour" and wonderful "galette des rois", the oldest bakery in Paris keeps the tradition alive.
I recommend the alibaba trio with a rum baba and a baba with whipped cream, also an opportunity to learn more about the creator of the rum baba.
You'll be able to try the best bourdaloue tart.
If only for the rum baba.
Quality, tradition and taste!
I love it.
It wasn't too bad until the main course arrived‚Ä¶ with a big COCKROACH under it!
The waiter was obviously used to it so didn't even apologise.
Make a run for it, it's not too late.
One of the best couscous in Paris.
Excellent couscous, very good portion.
Very nice food and the staff is very welcoming.
They can't be bothered to work!
You really feel like you're disturbing them‚Ä¶ avoid this place which uses to be so nice.
Worth queuing for a bit ‚Äì it's often full but there's a quick turnaround.
Various couscous options, all very nice, very tender meat, etc...
But the staff are not always very welcoming, the service is efficient but a bit commercial, and the restaurant is not very comfortable (too many tables crammed in).
Very good food, served quickly. The Moroccan wine is excellent.
It's a bit busy at lunchtime.
Nice couscous with a slightly sweet sauce and nice vegetables but the chicken and lemon tagine was a bit bland and disappointing.
Other than that, the staff is smiley and friendly.
Very good and very generous portions!
Sweet couscous.
The oriental ice cream is a real treat!
Delicious! So much food you can't eat it all!
And great service.
Avoid sitting by the entrance, you'll have people queuing behind your back while they wait for a table‚Ä¶
Very good!!
Lots to eat!
Good value for money for couscous.
Very good couscous!!!
The best. :)
Very disappointing!
Very bland couscous, inattentive staff!
The couscous royal is delicious.
Generous portions.
Good luck if you try to eat it all!
Always packed.
Arrive early especially at the weekend.
The cold sweet couscous is delicious, try it! :)
Good Moroccan restaurant.
Not one of the best in Paris but perfectly fine.
And the waiters are very pleasant.
The couscous is nice and there's plenty of it.
The lunch set menu is worth it; best to opt for the Moroccan pastries rather than for the starters which are nothing special.
A tourist trap.
We didn't like it at all.
6th anniversary party, photos from the Mardi Gras evening.
"M√©chant" burger to share with a girlfriend!
Watch out: if you order a sauce and saut√©ed mushrooms with your rib of beef as suggested by the waiter +$11 on your bill!!!
Nice team.
The oysters are always fresh.
Explore the wine selection in a very pleasurable atmosphere.
The meat was very nice, very professionally cooked and the wine sauce was amazing!!!!
Poutine!!!!
Great first impression with a very warm welcome (thank you), friendly atmosphere.
Don't go there on a Sunday, they serve brunch and it's not great.
Children served after the adults.
The tartare trio is fantastic so are the oyster served with a delicious sauce.
The best tartare ever!
Great service.
The lamb shank was tasty and very tender, the beef was delicious. Good beer too.
All you need to spend a perfect romantic dinner or a great evening with friends.
I recommend it strongly.
Very good crab cake, calamari, pork poutine and tartare trio!
The music can be a bit loud.
Nice atmosphere.
Too noisy: the music is too loud and people have to shout to hear each other!
Very dark!
We ate quickly so we could leave!
Mardi Gras party to celebrate the 6th anniversary in pictures.
Good burgers :) I loved the Samantha Fox!
The desserts are not worth having though‚Ä¶
And don't sit by the door in winter or you'll regret it!
The l√©guman!
Delicious!
The staff were great, very smiley and friendly. You can ask for adjustments, just check what'd possible.
You can book ahead.
The burgers are average.
I recommend Houtsiplou, on Place Rouppe, 2 minutes away.
For similar prices, they serve far better burgers.
Nice place where you can sit down to eat a bagel in a peaceful environment.
Really not worth the detour!
Very very average.
The service wasn't great.
In short, you might try it once BUT not twice.
Delicious gazpacho on the house while you wait and very nice bagel, even if the guacamole wasn't great.
Good burgers and bagels.
But the service is not always great and your clothes smell of cooking when you leave.
If you can sit on the terrace, it's perfect.
The bagels are very greasy and the service is rubbish.
No Wi-Fi
No wholemeal option, just one type of bagel on offer.
No pastrami on that day.
Etc.
Etc.
Oh dear!
Very nice burgers ‚Äì a few veggie option for bagels and burgers and good service!
Excellent burgers, fairly original combinations, and good quality meat.
Delicious burgers, good value for money!
If you're in Brussels and you dream of a tasty burger with nice side dishes, don't hesitate to try these‚Ä¶
They're delicious :)
Nice place and quality burgers.
I recommend the "speedy" if you like your food with a bit of a kick.
Nice but the service is not brilliant and the Patsy Brunch is a bit dry (bagel and fried eggs).
Meh!
Very good!
But the blond waitress is really unpleasant.
It's a shame.
A nice address for foodies, ideal for lazy Sundays ;)
Open Tuesday to Sunday from 12-3 pm and from 7-11 pm; at the weekend open 12-11pm non-stop.
The Chuck Burger is really amazing!!!
Try it!
The owner is really sweet.
Great experience!!
Very good, we'll go back next time we're in Brussels.
Here you'll find burgers with a Japanese, American, Mediterranean or European twist.
There's even a traditionally cooked "Escalibada" and a vegan burger.
Tried the "Grand Jojo" bagel‚Ä¶ excellent!!
Really fresh, good portions, the chicory is to die for.
No complaints about the food quality.
Only downside, a bit pricey (‚Ç¨12).
We've often walked past it without stopping.
The Yoko burger is amazing!
By far the best bagel/burger place of the capital!!
The d√©cor is ‚Ä¶ unusual.
Great bagels!
Prices could be a tad lower but it‚Äôs worth it!
Perfect quality, good service, considerate and quick.
Very authentic Japanese restaurant.
The ramen is excellent, the udon is even nicer!
Everything is nice!
Very helpful staff, which makes the Kokuban experience even better!
As always totally delicious!!!!
But make sure you end the meal with some ginger ice cream.
A real treat!
Great dumplings as a starter.
Snobbish staff, impersonal atmosphere, everything is rushed‚Ä¶
Meh‚Ä¶
Excellent ramen.
A friendly place where you're welcomed with a smile (even when you arrive too early).
Japanese restaurant specialised in ramen.
Noodles, chicken and soy soup with vegetables, pork slices or chicken legs.
A great selection.
A place where you can sample genuine Japanese cuisine.
Great gyoza.
Not to mention the ramen which are to die for.
Excellent black and white sesame ice cream.
Very good Japanese restaurant serving nice ramen, udon, edamame and desserts. No bookings taken so you may have to queue.
Gyoza for starter, gyudon as a main and sake to end the meal!
1st visit: delicious!!
Very nice set menu but I thought the noodle portions were too small. Left the place feeling I needed more food.
The salmon and gyoza mix as a starter is amazing.
Family atmosphere at lunchtime on Saturdays.
The ramen was great and the gyodon was delicious.
Perfect every time.
Very attentive service.
Best Japanese restaurant in the capital!!!
Beautiful but minimalist d√©cor, you can grab a big bowl of noodle soup and eat tapas-style food as you would if you were in Japan.
Everything is delicious. It's very simple, soups, raw food but also cooked food. My favourite Japanese restaurant in town.
Trendy d√©cor and the staff is very sweet.
Worth going to for a different type of Japanese cuisine.
On the menu, gyoza, ramen, soba, salads‚Ä¶
A very good place to visit if you fancy Japanese food.
Very good ramen and gyoza.
But the sashimi are small and not particularly nice.
So not the best place for sashimi.
Very nice Japanese food for a decent price.
The restaurant is pleasant but it gets noisy quite rapidly.
A few high tables ideal for chatting.
Good to know: you can't book.
Nice place, good food ‚Äì the ramen are top notch and so are the gyoza.
And the staff is really sweet.
A Japanese restaurant really worth visiting.
Especially if you're keen on gyoza.
The soup was a bit too salty for my liking.
Delicious sashimi maguro.
A nice subdued place in the Japanese tradition; affordable prices.
What else could you ask for?
At lunchtime, make sure you arrive very early or there's no chance you'll get a chance.
Other than that, it's all very tasty :)
Really brilliant!
The ramen are wonderful but so are the gyoza.
The tuna otsunami is a brilliant starter.
I mostly go there for the noodle soups, they're really good.
Great Japanese restaurant, order ramen and gyoza.
The sake is excellent (roughly ‚Ç¨40).
At the end of the meal, try the black sesame ice cream!!
Yum!
Busy place, good quality dishes.
Nice setting.
A bit noisy though.
Japanese restaurant specialised in ramen.
Noodles, chicken and soy soup with vegetables, pork slices or chicken legs.
A great selection.
A very straightforward Japanese restaurant, the ‚Ç¨12 set menu is worth it.
Very long wait before you get a table.
But the place is beautiful and the food is delicious.
Especially the gyoza.
The ramen are ok but a bit disappointing.
Faultless service. Don't forget to order onogiri!
A friendly place, fresh ingredients, a quick Japanese-style "tapas" set lunch.
Irresistible white or black sesame ice cream!!
The gyudon was really good!
Perfect for a quick lunch before a walk along Ixelles' water features.
Well, I was disappointed.
Bland soup, too salty, with very hard noodles.
The starter was ok but not great.
Overall not great‚Ä¶
This is where you will find the best fries!!
For only ‚Ç¨5 a portion‚Ä¶
Don't hesitate!!
My favourite place to watch a match!
Watch your bags, computer bags, etc.
The basement room and the beer are nice!!
Of course not, stupid white people!
Darts, football, burger and chips and not hipster in anyway.
A real English pub, perfect!
A nice place to watch a match.
The food is good!
If you order a mega munch, make sure you‚Äôre hungry!
A Lion burger and a pint of Kilkenny in front of a football match.
What's not to like?
Under new management: apparently, sports is no longer one of their priorities.
Let's wait and see‚Ä¶
(Comment left on 08/09/2013)
Well, they're nicer at Moose!
Great atmosphere, big portions, delicious food!
A really nice pub. :D
Under new management.
They served a pint of Guinness in one go‚Ä¶ not sure I'll come back‚Ä¶
Ideal to watch FCNA matches.
Good guitarist-singer on Thursdays.
Delicious.
Local savoury bites.
Fresh ingredients!
Delicate dishes and sophisticated service.
Don't hesitate‚Ä¶
Very good, and not very expensive given the quality of the ingredients,
We had a very nice time, with top-notch organic wine in a magnum-size bottle :) Remember to book ahead!
<URL>
Make sure you try the very delicious "croq'homard"!!!
Never disappointed by this restaurant.
The terrace is very pleasant in summer, though there's a fair bit of traffic nearby.
The lobster "croque" and the fruit tart are excellent.
Quality food, the dishes are simply fantastic not to mention the desserts, delicious!
Great service.
Try it with no hesitation.
You can order the daily specials to go.
And they're very good.
A great place for an aperitif or for dinner ;) Beautiful place!
Great quality ingredients!
Great local dishes and ingredients, creative menu and tempting set menus.
The view is very pleasant!
Nice d√©cor, friendly staff, quality food and wine but don't order a starter‚Ä¶I won't dwell on the steamed artichoke which was verging on the ridiculous... The desserts are really worth trying though.
Very fresh ingredients in an atypical setting!
I particularly recommend the "croq'homard" and the salmon and asparagus terrine.
The wine is a bit expensive but very nice.
As delicious as ever!
It's always very good!
The staff are really sweet and efficient.
The quality of the food is great and you can tell the cooks enjoy what they do.
Grilled chicken as a starter!!
You won't ever want to leave!
Very good if you like Japanese soups.
Very good and tasty.
Soy sauce ice cream, OMG!
In my opinion, the kara-age fired chicken is a must.
The quail eggs in soy sauce are excellent!
The "kara age" fried chicken is a must‚Ä¶ so delicious!
The fried chicken‚Ä¶ a must.
Best ramen in town; they also do fishcakes.
It‚Äôs a genuine Japanese restaurant, the ramen is delicious!
Excellent!
Fresh and tasty.
You simply have to go, for the food and for the atmosphere!
And it's cheaper than going to Japan!
Excellent typically Japanese soups.
Don't buy the bowls to take-away though, they'll collapse!
Shoyu soup as a starter, simple but delicious!!
Impossible to end the meal without the soy sauce ice cream‚Ä¶
I love it!!
It simply blew me away.
The staff order the dishes in Japanese!
Try the pork dumplings, good selection of sake.
A hint of yuzu in the Sapporo‚Ä¶
Try the edamame, as for the ramen: miso soup (we tried both the miso one is nicer!), sake sayuri, green tea and red bean ice cream with umeshu!!!!
The basket of fried chicken makes a nice starter to share between two people.
Yes, very nice croissant and "croque-gentilhomme"!
In the morning a macchiato and a croissant for ‚Ç¨3 ‚Äì a must.
Excellent pastries and cakes and nice Club Lacombe.
Everything changes for the worst‚Ä¶ that's a shame, I used to love this place :(
Very nice cakes and pastries.
A very place for a coffee.
The homemade cakes and pastries are delicious ;-)
The pancake is to die for!
Very good coffee and terrace in the sun in the morning.
Professional service, the staff gets really friendly when you become a regular.
Croissants!
The chicken supreme is delicious!
Heated terrace very pleasant in winter.
Happy hour on weekdays!
Lemon meringue tart to die for!!!
Very good quality!
I love this place.
Hot chocolate to die for!
I also recommend the classic burger, the French burger or the club sandwich.
A nice place with nice staff.
Perfect for a drink, to do a bit of work or to relax.
Their Mac Mahon is simply the best club sandwich in Paris (and I'm an expert!).
Croissants!
Everything is good, including the pastries, croissants and bread which are made on site.
Available to take away (very handy at the weekend).
Always perfect in the day.
Top-notch homemade pastries and cakes + fantastic croissants!
Very unwelcoming.
The waitress didn't want to apply the Happy hour rate because according to "her watch", we were three minutes early.
She also refused to wait three minutes before she took the order.
The cheeseburger is delicious.
The molten chocolate cake is amazing and <NAME> is very nice.
Great happy hour rates on beers!
The homemade crisps are a great little bonus!
Nice d√©cor and warm atmosphere, nice food, decent prices.
Happy hour on all cocktails until 9pm.
Very generous brunch on Sundays!
Nice place ;-)
You need to go there a few times so you can try everything.
Excellent pastries and cakes, like the Gu√©rande for example.
People buy the chocolates by the dozen.
Colombian hot chocolate‚Ä¶
Very very nice, subtle taste!
Chocolate maker by trade, his passion lead him to create pastries and cakes.
His macarons have received awards from the Figaro and the Guide des macarons.
Allow around 44.50 euros for a box of 30.
Very refined!
A magnificent place, perfect for a cup of tea, delicious pastries and cakes.
The dark chocolate ganache is exquisite.
The truffles are a bit disappointing in my opinion. The centre is too soft and not chocolatey enough.
The boxes are very pretty and make a perfect gift.
They also serve lunch.
Very nice cr√®me br√ªl√©e macaron.
Chocolate in all shapes and forms! Have a hot chocolate and a pastry!
Try the equator "grand cru"!
The spice and ginger chocolate remains my favourite.
Unbeatable!
A new collection called "Envie".
It's worth having a look at (and tasting): the chocolate stiletto shoe, the macaron pyramid, the citrus fruit jelly tubes, the hazelnut cream‚Ä¶.
Nice lunch but the extra parmesan was charged at ‚Ç¨6.50 ‚Äì a RECORD!
The raspberry-flavoured hot chocolate is to die for!!
Try the "Princesse Vanille".
It's fab!
Have lunch or tea in the upstairs room.
Try the macarons ‚Äì the flavours are amazing!
Disgusting!
Very expensive and typical of the overrated luxury of Avenue Montaigne.
An ideal location in the heart of the very chic Avenue Montaigne.
Great for a drink.
Friendly atmosphere and very attentive waitress.
Official meeting point of siliconed MILFs and "watch me I'm on TV" types.
A catwalk.
Plenty of pretty girls around.
The waitresses are clearly not very sophisticated nor qualified.
Not in line with the prices.
Being bold enough to say: "we don't have jugs of tap water" is rather incredible!
I definitely don't recommend it.
Small chicken springrolls!
The waitresses are clearly not very sophisticated nor qualified.
Not in line with the prices.
Being bold enough to say: "we don't have jugs of tap water" is rather incredible!
I definitely don't recommend it.
It's a bit out of fashion now, but the room is beautiful and so is the terrace on the pavement.
Part-trendy, part-business-like atmosphere, friendly welcoming staff, good service and quality food.
Expensive! You'd expect it in this area, but at least it's justified by the setting and the quality of the food.
Expensive, but delicious.
There are no veggie options.
Aperol Spritz ‚Ç¨18, 1/2 bottle of wine ‚Ç¨27 minimum.
Subtle service.
Reasonably priced.
And the toilets are particularly suited to cocaine consumption.
This shisha bar is very nice.
A cool place, very good service.
It's a bit of a shame that the team changes all the time.
Fixed-term contracts?
Extras?
Maybe.
Everything else is near perfect.
Excellent mojitos!
Dreadful service.
The service is not great ‚Ä¶
The waitresses don't do justice to the place‚Ä¶
Rude and not sophisticated.
They started clearing the table when we hadn't finished and made comments about her conversation‚Ä¶
Not so good!
I really don't recommend it.
The same menu as Le Coq ‚Äì well done for being so original. The waiters are rubbish and far too scruffy for this kind of place.
Efficient.
In the Costes style.
A spot for media and fashion "stars" and "aspiring stars" in this celebrity neighbourhood.
Posh audience for those who like that kind of thing.
The crying tiger is much better than it is at Thiou's.
Part-trendy, part-business-like atmosphere, friendly welcoming staff.
The food is up to standard as is the service.
Quality ingredients.
Expensive which is not surprising for this neighbourhood but worth it.
A historical place: Mont Saint-Michel oldest restaurant dating back to 1888!
A lot of famous people have visited this place, from the Japanese emperor to Leon Trotsky or Fran√ßois Mitterrand.
I was so looking forward to going to Mont Saint-Michel and I was looking more and more forward to it.
It was expensive though.
And a bit average although I was so looking forward to it.
Don't bother, unless you want to waste money on a disgusting omelette.
Evening of Wednesday the 10th of August.
The omelette is wonderfully light and creamy, and made with quality ingredients. Admittedly, it's not cheap but I wasn't disappointed; the quality and the service are worth the money.
Happy I tried it but I won't go back.
It wasn't nice but it was very expensive.
Warning!!!
The ‚Ç¨15 set menu is only for children.
And the ‚Ç¨25 menu is for 100g of lobster; as the lobsters weigh about 300g, it will cost you ‚Ç¨75.
Watch out!!!!
Nothing special and it's expensive.
Rubbish salad, hardly any chips with the mussels and the apple tart was yucky.
The cider is nice though.
Very expensive, the food is just about ok but the service is dreadful: very slow, the dessert was brought to the table before the starter!, no bread, no water‚Ä¶
The omelette gang rip-off‚Ä¶
If they carry on taking the piss when dealing with tourists, the news will spread all the way to Japan! Total tourist trap!
It's really the first I witness people taking the piss to that extent.... Whether it's the restaurant of the hotel, how can you charge so much for such rubbish services?! They should be so ashamed.
Evening of Wednesday the 10th of August.
The price reflects the nobility of the premises, it seems, and they really don't give a toss about those who don't appreciate the gastronomy‚Ä¶
Don't forget to book!
A tourist that doesn't get conned is not really a tourist‚Ä¶
Having that said, the famous M√®re Poulard omelette‚Ä¶
My meal was really dreadful and I paid a fortune.
Deeply disappointed.
Nice, but a bit expensive‚Ä¶
My advice: have a big breakfast before visiting Mont Saint-Michel and have lunch at 3pm before heading off: omelette +dessert set menu ‚Ç¨30.
A truly unique omelette which you should try at least once in your life.
A disgrace to the French hotel business, a disgrace to the French restaurant business.
Ok, it IS outrageously expensive for an omelette, and yes, you have to read the small print on the menu carefully and not order any alcohol, but it's something you should experience at least once.
The best Bo Bun in Paris!
If you're lucky, you won‚Äôt have to queue outside!
Otherwise, be patient, it's really worth it!
The best Bo Bun in Paris‚Ä¶
Only a dozen of seats and no possibility to book.
Just be patient‚Ä¶
Don't spread the word too much‚Ä¶
Clearly the best pho in Paris.
You go in, you sit down, you gobble up your food and you leave :-)
Excellent Bo Bun for only ‚Ç¨8.50.
Quality and quantity!
The springrolls are very crispy and the sauce is delicious!
Very nice neighbourhood!
A bit of a wait though!
A family-run restaurant open for over 20 years.
Very nice Pho and Bo Bun in small or big portions.
Be prepared to queue.
Nice place.
If you wonder why there's always a queue outside, it's simply because the Bo Bun is exceptional‚Ä¶ and is really cheap.
Enjoy the caramelised pork ribs!
Authentic and delicious.
Nested in a lovely building, this is a great place for excellent Bo Bun.
The staff are very attentive.
Be patient if you arrive between 12 and 2pm.
One of my favorite Pho.
Arrive early to avoid queuing.
The best Pho in the world.
Delicious Bo Bun
Excellent Pho in this tiny restaurant.
As long as you don't mind queuing for a bit.
Beautiful, tasty Bo Bun!
Very good latte, nicely strong.
The best coffee in Montreal?
I think so!
One of the best caf√©s in Montreal.
Excellent coffee.
What a nice selection of coffee beans‚Ä¶
Always difficult to buy just one packet!
I'm pleased to be working in this neighbourhood now, if only for the best white coffee in the area!
Or possibly in Montreal.
Undoubtedly the best latte in Montreal, and by far.
Jean-Marc welcomes you with a smile.
A young coffee merchant, he also used to be quality control manager of 24 coffee merchants in North America!
He organises coffee tasting courses.
It's really worth going along!
Quality espresso, full of flavour!
The staff are very friendly and take the time to chat.
Enjoy the diversity of the various coffees served at Gamba's.
JF knows how to cultivate what makes his strength.
A lovely place with divine food ‚Äì once again, Cyril, I'm falling for you ;)
Everything!!
The service, the food, the place, the spirit.
The staff are young, dynamic, kind and speak with a southern accent, just like young versions of Cyril Lignac.
Bistro atmosphere, just the way we like it.
Very friendly staff.
Nice presentation and delicious food.
Simply perfect!
Very welcoming and very friendly staff!
A very nice super in a subdued atmosphere, though a bit noisy.
Book to go and try it!
For example: try the vanilla ice cream with a hint of sea salt.
There's no better dessert in town!
Authentic and cosy setting, superb food made with quality ingredients.
It's like the time has stopped :) Go and try it soon!
The mini pains aux raisins are to die for, so is the raspberry French toast, served with Sicilian pistachio ice cream.
The food is not as good as they'll have think!
I'm not mad about the setting and the d√©cor, but the food is quite simply extraordinary.
The ingredients are top quality and the combination of flavours unbelievable.
Very good value for money.
Truly delicious: everything is perfect from the starter to the dessert and the service is great.
Top-notch service.
And everything tastes good.
It's so nice but it ends so quickly‚Ä¶ you'd want it to last forever!
‚Ç¨22 lunchtime menu (2 courses) or ‚Ç¨27 menu (3 courses).
Good service.
Excellent place.
This place offers original and very refined gourmet dishes, in a welcoming d√©cor.
Make sure you try the pure Aubrac beef burger!
It's excellent!
Good restaurant and good service with the wonderful "gourmand-croquant" ;)
Very cosy little room at the back.
The Angus steak (300g) is simply wonderful.
Confirmed by a true Argentinian‚Ä¶
And the proper profiteroles with cr√®me pat and melted chocolate‚Ä¶
Excellent!
Very good service, very nice dishes, nothing to complain about!
Beautiful setting!
The food is delicious!
Delicious but not very big for ‚Ç¨2.20!
Very friendly welcome, very nice bagel, good coleslaw, excellent cupcake, all for ‚Ç¨9.80!
What more can you ask for>
At Berko's everything is excellent!
So my advice is: even if you fall head over heels for the Oreo cheesecake or the milk foam cupcake, try a new one every time, Berko never disappoints!
A perfect example of American-style afternoon treats: dozens of cupcakes all more exotic than each other: Oreo, poppy, carambar... as well as cheesecake...
A calorie explosion!
Cupcake lovers, you‚Äôre in the right place.
Parisian macarons should fear the competition!
Avoid Saturday afternoons, it's packed.
They're taking the piss.
The cupcakes are ridiculously expensive and hollow in the centre.
Avoid this place.
Cheesecake to die for, great service, nice premises but too small.
Avoid going at the weekend if you want a better selection!
Try these famous cupcakes as soon as possible!
They're a bit expensive, but they're delicious.
They're pretty and they taste nice!
Famous for its cupcakes.
Avoid the violet flavour.
Avoid going there at the end of the day, there might not be many cupcakes left (or even none at all if you go after 6pm) but there's always cheesecake, absolutely delicious!
Ultra-modern bakery where you'll find the best cupcakes in Paris.
Try the Oreo one. Underground station: Rambuteau.
The best cupcakes in Paris.
Great selection and original creations, cute packaging!
Try these famous cupcakes as soon as possible!
For example: try the vanilla ice cream with a hint of sea salt.
There's no better dessert in town!
I wasn't really impressed by the cupcake, but the cheesecake was splendid!!!
Delicious!
You can't be disappointed.
Real American cupcakes.
So there's too much of everything: too greasy, too sweet, too heavy.
Don't say you weren't warned! :)
The best cupcakes in Paris, great d√©cor, high prices.
The cupcakes are really good.
Not too sweet, not too heavy.
Just right.
They're not too big so you can eat them without making a mess.
Perfect.
Very pretty little cakes‚Ä¶
But watch out, they‚Äôre very sweet.
The best cupcakes in Paris! The Dexter one is awesome;)))
Yum‚Ä¶ Very friendly, very good cupcakes.
The best cupcakes in Paris.
So nice you risk biting your fingers when you eat them.
Enter this little shop and you'll be amazed by the range of colours of their cupcakes (on the right-hand side) and by their cheesecakes (on the left).
The cupcakes are delicious.
I got there 20 minutes before closing time and it was almost empty.
But the cupcakes are very tempting and the cakes are wonderful.
I ordered a mascarpone/raspberry one!
I can wait to taste it.
The quiches are very nice, especially the three cheese one.
Delicious cake.
Trendy d√©cor, typical of the Marais area.
Attentive and efficient staff.
Try these famous cupcakes as soon as possible!
Go to Berko's, you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The cupcakes are all equally nice, I love them!
They don't serve the pasta in a parmesan cheese wheel anymore but it's still as tasty!
Faultless service.
But you have to be there early.
I got there ten minutes before the opening time and I got the last table.
The good ingredients make it worthwhile: burrata, dried sausage.
The pizzas are always a safe bet.
The pasta dishes are amazing.
There are always new dishes to make you feel like coming back.
Expect cheerfulness and Italian accents.
Ok, it‚Äôs a good Italian restaurant but I don't understand why everybody is making such a fuss about it.
The pasta and the starters are good but I was disappointed by the wine. Great service though!
Try it!
A bit disappointed after all the publicity since it opened.
It's good but it's nothing special.
Great atmosphere and beautiful d√©cor though.
Mamma Primi, the 3rd restaurant of the Big Mamma group, is opening today.
The restaurant is quite simply magnificent and the food is divine.
The new hot spot in the Batignolles area!
Everything is good and looks very fresh‚Ä¶
Very very good, just like the other restaurants of the group!
And just like for the other places, you have to arrive early to get a table.
All the pasta, not just the truffle one, is excellent.
Small downside: there's not quite enough on the plates.
Great Bloody Mary!
Subdued lighting, cosy place, Italian pizza to die for. You should also try the chestnut pina colada. I strongly recommend this place.
Another of these places people rush to for no good reason.
You can't book, you have to wait forever and the staff at the entrance are pretty unpleasant.
Good pizzas and pasta, mediocre but expensive wine.
The cacio e pepe is visually very impressive, but careful you don't get splashed when you get served.
It's good but it's not an amazing place.
The restaurant itself is magnificent, just like the other two.
Get up early if you want to get a table!
But it's worth it, it's very nice food!
The tiramisu is to die for.
A bit puzzled as to why this restaurant, which is decent but not amazing, is so popular.
The menu is 100% American.
Tasty classics and a very 7th arrondissement atmosphere.
A tad expensive.
The French toast is excellent and there's plenty of it.
Best to share.
The food is very good, the waitresses are friendly.
The service is very slow though.
Which isn‚Äôt great if you‚Äôre on your lunch break.
Excellent girly salad!
Don't forget to book!
Excellent iced tea too.
The carrot cake is a bit bland.
Yummy but a bit pricey!
Excellent dishes but the service is incredibly slow!
The waitress memorises your order (not sure this is the moment time efficient way of doing things). Decent prices.
Everything is excellent!
The super food salad is delicious, the pancakes are very filling, and it's all healthy food. Worth a few visits.
Very slow service: one hour wait between ordering and getting our food‚Ä¶
Excellent fish and chips, and unmissable waffles in a d√©cor very similar to that of the Montmartre branch.
Well done Marcel 2 (book ahead!)
An interesting experience: the waitresses carry on chatting behind the bar rather than taking your order, bringing you water or bread, or bringing the credit card terminal.
Avoid it.
The best tapas we've had!
A long wait but it was worth it.
Delicious.
After a good day sightseeing, a great tapas bar with delicious food and excellent mojitos.
Delicious tapas bar and great sangria.
We had a very nice meal and the service was great.
The camembert crispies are amazing.
The best tapas I've ever had!
My advice: be patient and sit at the bar to get the most of the atmosphere.
A great place even for Barcelonians who often come in bigger numbers than the tourists‚Ä¶
Try the camembert skewer!!!
A great selection of tapas, everything is fried at the last minute.
The best thing to do is to sit at the bar and watch the taps being prepared.
‚Ç¨20 per person.
I recommend the calamari!
Probably the best tapas in Barcelona!
Sandwiches, tortillas, fried food, min-burgers and hot-dogs‚Ä¶
Perfect for tapas.
Espectacular, a preu de risa, well done!!!
Good food, great service, good value for money.
Best tapas bar in Barcelona‚Ä¶
My best tapas experience to date.
An incredible selection of tapas, great quality, reasonably priced.
Be aware that you can't book so there's often an hour's wait.
Cabreaos Eggs Style
Excellent tapas/friendly service. A good idea to sit at the bar.
The crema catalana is delicious.
In the heart of the trendy/boho Marais area, a pleasant terrace though the service is a bit rubbish.
The salmon burger served with chips is both original and delicious!
Wi-Fi.
A vaguely boho place. The burgers are predictable, neither particularly good nor particularly bad.
The Caesar salad is a joke :-D!!
You have to be a tourist to go to this place.
Delicious!
Trendy bistro, always packed. A simple menu but good ingredients. Pleasant service.
A perfectly balanced brunch with salmon scrambled eggs, a small tomato salad, cream cheese with parsley, a portion of fruit salad, and French toast served with a fresh fruit juice and a cup of tea.
Very nice.
A bit expensive but a good selection of burgers.
Free Wi-Fi and iced chocolate with whipped cream.
Ideal if you want to do a bit of work on your laptop on a week day.
Make sure you try the very unusual salmon burger.
Delicious!
The best table is the one at the back with a wall seat; or if the weather is nice you can sit outside on the terrace.
It takes an hour for your dish to arrive?
It doesn't matter.
Relax, enjoy and connect to <URL>.
Best warm goat cheese salad I've ever had.
A tourist trap: outrageous prices for some very average food.
Avoid the club sandwiches.
I really don't recommend this place!
Just one word: expensive.
Don't stick around, you'll find a nicer place in the neighbourhood,
A good place for sampling a good quality burger (the meat is very nice) served with chips in a pretty container or a beef tartare, which is also worth the detour!
A glass of single barrel and a scoop of hazelnut ice cream.
Life can be so simple.
One of the best burger joint in Paris.
Miami-style atmosphere.
By far the best burgers in Paris!
Very good burgers and a colourful d√©cor which makes you feel like you're in Miami.
After Oberkampf and Faubourg Saint-Denis, PNY opens its third restaurant in Paris, a few minutes away from the 3rd arrondissement town hall.
The burgers are still as delicious.
Cosy "pop Nordic" d√©cor.
Further seating upstairs.
A few tables outside.
Very good burgers but hectic service.
Really juicy cheddar/bacon burger and fries!
Go there when you‚Äôre really hungry. Excellent!
The loaded fries are excellent.
I strongly recommend them.
Fantastic burgers with vegetarian and vegan options.
The lemon grass is wonderful!
Good burgers, no surprises.
The place is nice and the waiters are very pleasant.
Very good burgers!
The cheesecake is delicious too.
Friendly service.
We ordered the cow-boy burger with chips and it was delicious.
The food is excellent, so is the service. I'll be back/
The burgers are exceptionally good.
PNY re-opens its restaurant near the Carreau du Temple!
The service is still a bit slow but the American style burgers are good quality.
Good burgers and nice homemade lemonade.
So greasy but so nice!
Very good burgers.
One of the top 3 burger joints in Paris alongside Blend and Big Fernand.
Arrive early if you don't want to queue.
Healthy homemade burgers (the bread is delicious0, the d√©cor is fairly plain but elegant.
Don't forget to book as it gets full very quickly ‚Äì it's a sought-after place.
The best burger (and probably the most calorific one) I've had in my life so far!
Great burgers in a nice setting.
The restaurant and the atmosphere are totally different from the Strasbourg St Denis PNY, but the food's quality is the same.
A double Cowboy, chips and a beer, a perfect combination‚Ä¶
Desserts for all tastes!
But the cheesecake is nothing special!
I recommend the chia pudding, the pancakes or the French Toast!
70 euros for a piece of meat.
Meat for around the world!
Try the daily specials!
A restaurant with a South American twist.
Very large selection of grilled meat.
Near perfect cooking and side dishes.
Disappointing.
The meat was medium rare though we had asked for it to be rare, the Crozes hermitage was tasteless even after we got the bottle changed, the exotic fruit Fontainebleau was just whipped cream...
"Do you want to know everything about Charbon rouge?
Visit <URL> and download our app!"
Hectic service.
As soon as it gets a bit busy, there's a long wait‚Ä¶
Check your bill careful, especially if you ordered a set menu.
Beef lovers will be delighted.
The prices are high bit reflect the quality of the meat. In the end, the lunchtime set menu is really good value given how good it is.
Friendly welcome, if you like meat, this is the place for you.
Try the sweet potato chips.
Excellent meat and great atmosphere especially on Friday and Saturday evenings, thanks to excellent cocktails.
Ask for the Mathias rouge.
The meat is tender, the prices a bit harsher.
But it's definitely worth a visit.
Very nice red meat‚Ä¶
Sophisticated dishes!!! My favourite: the burger which is simply delicious, as a side you can choose from salad, homemade fries or grilled vegetables.
A proper steakhouse.
The meat is delicious.
Go for the beef, it's their specialty.
The sweet potato chips are very nice and the creamy chocolate cake is wonderful.
I recommend a double arak to start with‚Ä¶
A classic‚Ä¶ I'd recommend stopping on the other side of the road to order the take-away version though ;)
It used to be fairly nice a long time ago.
Now it's merely a Lebanese McDonald's.
Unbearable service or rather lack of service. Doesn't help that the quality of the food is really poor and the prices are really high.
Manaich labne I've had enough.
A perfect Lebanese restaurant: very good!!
Well known Lebanese restaurant in the area.
Terrace; average service.
Opt for the take-away sandwiches rather than eating in.
Since they've opened the new kitchen, the quality has gone downhill, the portions have shrunk and the prices have gone way up!
There's nothing nice about this once great Lebanese restaurant anymore.
The take-away set menus are great value for money. Add a portion of houmous (their olive oil is delicious) and some bread: a real treat!
The staff and the service are far from fantastic.
The food is alright though.
Very expensive for frozen food (desserts).
My favourite Lebanese restaurant.
It's turned into a factory.
What a shame!
Very nice food, no complaints whatsoever, I go there every time I'm in Paris :)
Very good, but no better than most restaurants.
The service is totally rubbish though, choose the one near the Opera instead‚Ä¶
The best Lebanese restaurant in Paris.
Shawarma, houmous, moutabal, yummy!!!!
So good :)
Very unpleasant staff, good dishes.
My girlfriend and I went there today and the pistachio ice cream is miles better than any of the ones I've tried elsewhere.
The soft vanilla ice cream cone contains real vanilla beans.
Worth a look! :-D
The ice cream is excellent, the d√©cor (inside and out) is pretty.
Try their sorbets, you won't regret it ;) TRUST ME GUYS #YUMMY
Delicious grapefruit and blackcurrant sorbets!!
A tub of sorbet please: my three favourite flavours (Passion fruit, blackcurrant, strawberry). An excellent place; the staff are always friendly and helpful.
If nothing else it really cools you town during heatwaves ;)
The sorbets are excellent and the cones are homemade :)
Tell <NAME> to take his wooly hat off.
Better than Meu Meu!
The ice creams and sorbets are made with high quality ingredients.
The sorbet made with peaches from Ontario in its "soft version" = sublissimo.
Ask <NAME> about the latest soft sorbet/soft ice cream flavours!
A place you simply have to go to!
Yes <NAME>!
Take your woolly hat off! :) Excellent ice cream.
The carrot ice cream is delicious!
So good!
Far better than the Bilboquet!
A classic but the soft vanilla ice cream is simply awesome!
A no brainer!
Try the barbecued marshmallow ice cream!!
Delicious :-P Make sure you ask for a homemade cone!!!!!
The soft vanilla ice cream is wonderful.
Artisan milk bar.
Hot and cold drinks.
Delicious ice cream.
Homemade cones and other desserts made on site.
Very affordable prices.
Free Wi-Fi.
Terrace.
A fantastic experience.
Delicious mojito!!!
Breakfast at the Milwaukee!
Perfect!
If you're after poultry, go to Saveurs de Margot.
Quality poultry prepared by an expert!
Try a yellow chicken from the Landes for your next "chicken Basquaise"!
You have to have a drink in L'Amuse gueule, inside the market hall.
Excellent bocadillo and tapas‚Ä¶
Friendly owners.
Everything Basque concentrated in a friendly spirit ‚Äì amazing!
Nice tapas from "L'Amuse gueule".
The city's market where you can find local produce!
Buy your cold meats from <NAME>, a very earnest man who sells authentic products!
Try the homemade foie gras!
The tapas are delicious and the waitress is nice (bowl of popcorn).
The boss call "crevette" is really great, he's a music fan (his playlists are amazing) and his cocktails are perfect to create a cool atmosphere!!!
Don't hesitate to go there, you won't be disappointed, honest.
Maison Balme üëç
Go and sample oysters from the oyster counter at the far end of the market hall.
The bakery called "Secrets de pain" is rather perfect.
Totally perfect even.
You have to try the "pain paillasse", which is‚Ä¶
Perfect!
‚Ç¨19 lunch set menu.
Bistro food with a twist, worth a look (and a taste).
A chic and friendly setting with an open kitchen and very attentive staff.
<PHONE>.
Set menu: ‚Ç¨23 (lunchtime). A la carte: ‚Ç¨27-30
Closed on Saturdays and Sundays.
Very good and original dishes, decent service, a tad too noisy.
Get the chef's menu, it's delicious!
Excellent John Dory with orange, ginger and chanterelle sauce.
Very nice setting, service and atmosphere!
The bill is a bit steep though!
The menu changes everyday and offers very tasty dishes.
Very nice set menu at lunchtime, very good value for money!
One of the best gastronomic restaurant we know; the restaurant itself and the food are a treat for all senses‚Ä¶
Friendly and attentive staff.
Excellent gastronomic restaurant!
The dishes are magnificent ‚Äì flavours that reflect the season and perfectly cooked ingredients.
The lunchtime set menu (starter, main course and dessert for ‚Ç¨18) is unbeatable.
The service is a bit rushed.
Very good restaurant; the service is a bit rushed though and the desserts are on the small side which leaves a bad taste in your mouth.
A small but interesting menu. A friendly typically Parisian atmosphere.
Excellent, the lunchtime set menus is unbeatable.
The quality of their cold meats is worth a mention!
Must do.
Top-notch food!
Complete set menu for ‚Ç¨19 (starter, main course, dessert). Very good quality.
Don't hesitate to try it.
A lot of promises but unfortunately too many disappointments.
Very expensive and very slow service.
A real shame.
Honestly‚Ä¶
It's magical‚Ä¶
It's really very good‚Ä¶
Absolutely delicious.
Choose the set menu, you won't be disappointed.
The wine is a very pricey though.
Very (very) tasty.
Attentive staff and pleasant setting.
Delicious hot chocolate (the orange one ++) and the brunch is to die for.
The products from the deli are also worth the detour.
The Caf√© Raphael‚Ä¶
Wonderful.
Surely the best hot chocolate in town!
Indulge in a hot chocolate, they're incredibly good!!!
The "Laurier" brunch I ordered was well balanced, filling and above all very very good!
A very nice place!
Lovely owner!
Excellent coffee!
A great selection of tea, sweet treats and ice cream.
A great place to enjoy an ice cream, a freshly squeezed juice or a milkshake in the sun.
Also a paradise if you fancy a sweet treat!
Whatever you do, don't miss out on Caf√© Rapha√´l : an espresso mixed with vanilla ice cream in a special gadget‚Ä¶ of the best coffee recipe in town!
A must in the summer, out on the terrace!
Come for brunch: the 5 options offered on the menu are original, around $16 and 3 out of 5 of them are suitable for vegetarians.
Be bold and have potato gratin for breakfast.
The lychee ice cream is worth the detour.
The soft ice cream made to order is delicious.
An original d√©cor and a great selection of all manners of sweets treats.
Try the famous Nutella ice cream!
The apple tart is amazing!
Often packed: choose a table on the ground floor if possible, not option to book ahead.
The best value for money in the neighbourhood.
Starters ‚Ç¨11, main courses ‚Ç¨16, desserts ‚Ç¨7.
Friendly efficient staff.
Beer on tap!
The profiteroles are excellent!
A real treat at the end of the meal.
I absolutely love this bistro which serves refined brasserie food. Unbeatable value for money.
At least at lunchtime.
One of my favourite spots alongside Les Cocottes nearby ‚Äì happy days.
I simply love the shredded crab with ratte potatoes.
An excellent Parisian brasserie with an interesting menu.
Chicken breast served with bacon bits (could not taste them), mushrooms, potatoes and Savoy cabbage.
Good, especially the poultry (nicely cooked, nice taste); the sides are not particularly interesting.
Starters: 1/ pumpkin soup, chestnut crumbs, cheese bites, fresh herbs and olive oil ‚Äì delicious, a perfect balance üå∞üåøüß° 2/ puff pastry prawn pie.
Very nice caf√© with a good atmosphere.
Very welcoming; as it's visited by a lot of tourists, you meet people from all around the world.
Very good value for money.
The chef, <NAME>, cooks excellent food.
I simply have to mention the chocolate profiteroles which are divine.
Delicious from start to finish and the bill was quite reasonable.
I recommend it strongly.
Thank you, Mr <NAME>, you are a magician.
I'd never tried such a nice foie gras.
The daily specials are often good and very reasonably priced!
It's not always terribly welcoming; this is such a busy place that they don't make much effort to get you to come back.
You sometimes have to wait 20 minutes before you can get a table.
But the service and the food are excellent.
A special mention for the chocolate "quenelles" for dessert.
The roast pork with thyme and garlic gravy and potato galette is excellent...
With <NAME> Constant standing on the terrace of his restaurant, it's bound to be a good day.
So let's go in for a feast!
How wonderful it is to discover a menu based purely on fresh products ‚Äì everything is made on site!
After a short wait, you're in for a treat!
The (giant) profiteroles are a perfect end to the meal!
Try the rib of veal wrapped in ham with Tarbais beans in goose fat.
A vanilla rice pudding to die for! (the portion is very big)
Nice place, excellent quality, reasonable price, standard service for a Parisian brasserie (meh!)
Very welcoming, dishes that will make everyone happy and a very good value for money daily set menu.
A charming place!
Not too expensive although it's near the Eiffel tower!
Delicious dishes.
Chef <NAME>'s brasserie.
Faultless service, sophisticated bistro dishes, a stone throw away from the Eiffel tower.
A real gem!
Salmon tartare, oyster and sea bass with ginger and shredded crab.
Classic dishes but fresh and delicious.
The lunchtime set menu offers unbeatable value for money, a stone throw away from the Eiffel tower.
Dessert of the day: Parisian flan and chocolate tart, homemade.
2 floors.
No possibility to book, but if you arrive by 12.15, you can usually get a table.
Helpful staff, fairly rapid service.
‚Ç¨36 set menu: starter/main course/dessert.
Sophisticated but simple d√©cor (typical bistro style).
Parisian flan: nice but I've had better.
The custard filling is very good, but the pastry is fairly ordinary.
The filling is smooth and tasty, with real vanilla.
You can't taste the eggs too much.
Don't order desserts.
Having had a fairly nice main course, I ordered profiteroles.
The result = Nestl√© ice cream, defrosted choux pastry and worse of all some sticky black liquid, which you'd expect to find in a Flunch self-service, instead of melted chocolate.
Noisy.
But unbeatable value for money.
Come on a Sunday lunchtime if you want to be sure to have a table.
So so good/doesn‚Äôt accept advance bookings.
The shawarma isn‚Äôt bad, but it is fairly greasy.
The best falafels in Paris!
Average falafels, dry pastries, served by sulky staff members.
I don't recommend it.
The falafel sandwich is more of a salad sandwich: only two falafels inside!
Go to Mi va mi, they're more generous with their food.
Not bad‚Ä¶ but it doesn't compare to l'As du falafel.
Always very busy, but it's not bad.
So much for l'As du falafel!
It's being overshadowed by this new kosher restaurant which is far friendlier and more reasonably priced.
Pay them a visit!
The staff are not particularly pleasant or friendly but the falafel sandwich is very good!
Bland and dry dishes.
The shawarma pita sandwich supposedly comes with salad, but it's more of a salad pita sandwich that comes with shawarma.
The meat is similar to that of a kebab restaurant.
Too expensive!
My first falafel in Paris.
I like it.
Very popular set menu prices.
The staff are really unpleasant but the food is nice!
They should know that a smile and a few kind words help you appreciate your meal‚Ä¶
The pita sandwiches are nice but the service is pitiful.
The guy who makes the sandwiches also handles the cash.
Not very clean.
One of the worst falafels I've had in this neighbourhood‚Ä¶
What's on the menu?
Mini French dishes which will only cost you ‚Ç¨3!
The dry Juran√ßon is amazing!
Try the cep mushrooms a la plancha are divine.
Have a glass of dry white wine with them.
Very friendly staff, great advice on which wine to choose.
This place is very busy, you have to be prepared to stand and to be a bit squashed.
Great place, you eat standing up, drinks and nibbles on the go, no chairs.
Ah, the waffles!!!
Password: hotelrsg.
The black pudding macaron is amazing!
A very nice place for an aperitif with friends while sampling local dishes.
My favourite: the foie gras skewer.
My darling devouring a roasted marrow bone while a bunch of American tourists devour him with their eyes.
One of my favorite place in Paris.
Nothing to complain about.
The best take-away buckwheat pancakes in Paris for a maximum of ‚Ç¨6.
Wine and tapas bar atmosphere inside, delicious pinchos.
Great wine bar, not too expensive for great quality drinks.
You have to stand and you're a bit squashed but it's not really a problem.
Excellent wine and typical French dishes served as tapas for ‚Ç¨3.
Excellent meal deals.
The wine is great, the nibbles are excellent and the atmosphere is fantastic.
I loved this place.
Excellent atmosphere and good grub.
Bistro food on the go (you have to stand), friendly staff, varied menu.
It's delicious.
At the moment, try the pork rind and trotters warm sausage and the mini bacon sandwich.
Nothing special!
As long as you‚Äôre not in a hurry, the food is nice!
Go to Khyber Pass and try their vegetarian platter: smooth aubergines, basmati rice with three sauces, akkras and spinach.
In the summer, their little terrace is very sweet.
Bring your own wine.
Good service, good food!
Very generous portions.
A perfect place for a different supper!
BYOW
Great BYOW option. Go for the "table d'h√¥te" option. The lamb shank and the dishes with sauce are delicious.
The skewers are less interesting.
BYOW Afghan restaurant.
Good food, nice atmosphere and perfect service (you don't have to wait long).
Tiny tables though, you feel squashed like sardines.
The best Afghan restaurant in Montreal ‚Äì try it!
Delicious Afghan food in a friendly atmosphere.
Try the pumpkin Borani to discover something new!
Excellent, delicious!
Excellent food.
The selection of desserts could be improved; as it is, there's only one tasty one‚Ä¶
Original and the texture is very unusual.
We had a very pleasant evening all the same.
The lamb is tender, everything is nice and spicy!
I liked it a lot‚Ä¶
You have to try the basmati rice!
The only Afghan restaurant in Montreal.
There's a second restaurant in Laval.
I had a skewer with three flavours of rice; although I don't like very hot food, I loved it!
A very nice place for supper with friends.
A great find.
Some of the best falafels in Paris and a warm welcome.
The shawarma chicken sandwich is very nice and not stodgy at all!!
The falafels are freshly prepared and fried on order.
Best falafel in Paris!
The falafel extra tastes delicious with an Aerran (fermented milk) drink!
Yummy!
I tried the vegetarian platter (‚Ç¨13) and I was amazed by the freshness of the houmous and of the baba ghanoush.
Great value for money!
Nice atmosphere.
A subtle mix between a newsagent and a Syrian/Lebanese deli (falafel, shawarma, tabouleh...); the place boasts simplicity and the quality of the food is top-notch.
Eat in or take away.
The mini aubergines stuffed with spices, walnuts and pomegranate: a must!
The falafels are really fresh compared to other Lebanese restaurants.
You can flick through magazines which is very pleasant.
The vegetarian platter is a must.
Everything is fresh and cooked on side, the restaurant/newsagent concept is really great.
My favorite sandwich: the kebbe!
Everything is very good, the salads and the sandwiches.
You definitely should go there.
Simple and straightforward, the sandwiches are awesome!
Very fresh dishes, very flavoursome!
If you want to feel like you‚Äôre in Syria for the duration of a lunch/dinner, this is the place!
I simply have to mention the magnificent wooden table (as a Swede, I know what I'm talking about)
We tried the mezze platter and the falafel menu.
Everything was very nice!
We'll happily go back again.
Excellent place to buy a nice falafel and a newspaper.
It's good, fresh and affordable, no complaints.
You can take a seat and enjoy reading the daily news or a literary magazine, it's up to you.
Opened a month ago.
Great!
Excellent service, excellent dessert, we had the French toast, it was the best I've ever had.
I strongly recommend it to everyone.
On of the best evening menu in Montreal (after 10 pm).
Excellent wine selection, fantastic atmosphere and the best French toast ever!
The 10pm table d'h√¥te now costs $27‚Ä¶ but it's still worth it :)
The French toast, more sugar than you need.
My advice?
Eat all you can! ;) It's really good!
Try the brunch!
Apart from that, <NAME>'s wine list is about to get as exciting as <NAME>.'s one.
The after 10pm menu is excellent.
I suggest the beef tartare from the starter section of the menu, if you're not very hungry!
Everything is good‚Ä¶
<NAME>.
I should try it one evening late if I'm out or if I have plans.
One of the best places in Montreal and perfect after 10pm = $25
Try the rib eye!!!
Delicious and cooked to perfection!!
Very disappointing brunch ‚Äì the service, the quality and the quantities could be much improved.
The platters are excellent.
The onion soup is exceptional, but there's far more than just soup here.
For a late night bite, tasty but not too expensive. Try the evening set menu (after 10pm): starter and main course for $25.
The desserts are particularly nice.
Well done to the pastry cook!
The post 10pm menu has gone up from $22 to $27 for a starter and a main course, but it offers a better selection and the food is still as delicious!!!
The bowl of mussels is enormous.
It's enough for two.
Warm goat cheese pastry, rack of lamb, black pudding‚Ä¶ and of course‚Ä¶ French toast!!!
Yummy!
After 10 pm, three courses for $22.
The "onglet" steak is always delicious.
And the French toast is‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ awesome!
Amazing salmon tartare and French toast to share for those who have a sweet tooth!
A safe bet!
If you want to spend a bit less, the post 10pm menu is really good value for money!!
$22 table d'h√¥te after 10 pm
Warm goat cheese pastry and braised beef short rib‚Ä¶
A must.
Try the potato tartlet.
Delicious tasty dishes + good wine.
Try the evening set menu (starter + main course) from 10pm onwards for $25 per person!
I recommend it, I'd very happily go back.
Friendly atmosphere, beautiful terrace, one of the most popular places in Outremont. Always a pleasure‚Ä¶ Delicious... The open space is well lit up. Top-notch bistro in Outremont.
The best tartare in town!
Excellent!
Especially after 10pm, table d'h√¥te for only $25‚Ä¶
Incredibly good!
Watch out everyone, new price for the late evening menu from tonight = $24! Not such a good marketing strategy.
The tartare dishes are delicious‚Ä¶ and I really find it impossible to resist the French toast :-)
The food was food but the staff really doesn't give a toss about the customers :(
A very nice place.
The white pizzas are great and there a choice of pizzas as daily specials.
The best pizza restaurant in Paris.
Always packed, no possibility to book ahead, so get there early‚Ä¶ or late.
Excellent pizzas but the staff are a bit overwhelmed and verging on being rude‚Ä¶
Maybe it was an off day‚Ä¶
Grand <NAME>'s recommendation: the smoked mozzarella pizza!
Unbelievable.
Avoid sitting under the heat lamps, the hot/cold contrast is unpleasant :-)
Quite simply the best pizzas in Paris!
The pizzas are excellent ‚Äì a real treat.
But what don't they do take-aways? :(
The best Neapolitan pizzas in the neighbourhood.
We love the calzoni.
Nice quiet terrace, ideal in the summer.
Tried as a take-away.
Absolutely delicious pizzas.
Decent prices.
The pizzas are always amazing.
But the service isn't at all.
The waitresses need to go on manners courses.
Best pizza in Paris. Thin crusty dough, very lively place, don't hesitate, it's really worth a visit!!
The best pizzas in Paris are here!
Despite their success, they're still laid back.
Good pizzas.
Decent prices.
And the bar opposite is a nice place if you have to wait for a table.
The pizzas are really good but no nicer than elsewhere.
Busy, come early or be prepared to wait.
The staff make a note of your mobile number and call you when there's a free table.
A nice setting, a wide range of pizzas, the white ones are worth a try!
The service was pleasant and the staff gave use good advice about the wine!
A long wait but nice pizzas.
And the staff was friendly, smiley and fun.
Unpretentious.
Pizzas range from 12 to 15 euros.
Now offers non-stop service at the weekend.
Excellent pizzas, pleasant setting, friendly.
Top-notch service.
Make sure you come early or book a table.
If you want to talk about paintings, <NAME>, the pizzaiolo, will be delighted to have a chat with you!
Everything.
With a small preference for the pizzas.
The staff could be bit friendlier sometimes‚Ä¶
The pizzas are good and so are the bruschettas.
The staff are cool.
Not far from the canal, it gets very busy.
The terrace is nice, in the sun.
A bit noisy inside.
Good pizzas and friendly service although you have to wait for a table.
But once you're sitting down, the pizzas are served very quickly.
The homemade lemon tart is delicious.
Other than that, all the pizzas are worth trying.
Very good pizza restaurant.
Try the white pizzas!
You'll have to ask for salt, pepper, water‚Ä¶
Avoid the carpaccio.
Lukewarm lasagna.
So why not try the restaurant next door.
Very good and the staff are very friendly!
Boho pizza restaurant just by the canal.
A friendly place with a modern minimalist d√©cor.
Very welcoming.
Very good wood-fired pizzas around ‚Ç¨15.
Good desserts ‚Ç¨8.
Nice wine from ‚Ç¨20-30.
Top-notch.
Expensive pizzas around ‚Ç¨14 each, not cooked In a wood-fire oven. Good but not excellent. The ingredients come out of tins. Very uncomfortable outside seating area.
As the end of the day, not such good value for money.
I wouldn't go as far as saying it's the best pizza restaurant in Paris, but it is very good, the service is great and the staff very friendly.
I recommend it!
I've been told it was the best pizza restaurant...
Well, I certainly wasn't disappointed!!
The pizza of the day was excellent!

The homemade tiramisu is perfect, great service.
The pizzas are delicious.
Make sure you go there soon!

I often go there.
For the terrace and to eat a Parma bianca!
Not to mention the pear and ricotta tart (dessert of the day).
It doesn't look like much, but the Pad Thai and the soups are delicious!
Far nicer (and friendlier) than the Bon Bol opposite!!!
Very welcoming and very good food.
Decent prices.
If you‚Äôre in the neighbourhood, make sure you stop by "Japan" (rue Sainte Catherine).
I recommend the scampi and vegetables with rice; in my opinion, it's their best dish.

Ask for a loyalty card.
The vegetarian Pad Thai is really delicious.
Very welcoming.
Delicious!

I've been there a few times and I always ate well.

Bland.
I don't recommend it.
Go to the Bon Bol opposite.
It's nicer and cheaper.
Saut√©ed noodles!
Nice little place a quick Asian meal at lunchtime, it's nicer than grabbing something from a fast-food joint.
Excellent value for money!!!
Fresh and delicious.
Ideal for eating a portion of noodles on the go, standing at the bar.
No comment‚Ä¶
Simply delicious and very welcoming!!!
Burgers would be enough to make you change religion!
Great selection of burgers and delicious smoothies.
Very smiley staff.
Watch out‚Ä¶ I've had a nasty case of food poisoning after eating one of their burgers‚Ä¶ :( they should be a bit more careful about how fresh their ingredients are.
Having tried lots of beef burgers, I can't complain about how big theirs are, on the contrary.
Great size and great quality of the burgers for the price!
Magnificent!!!
Scampi with garlic sauce as a starter‚Ä¶
Really delicious. Followed by an amazing burger!!!
Don't hesitate to come here, you‚Äôre in for a treat.
Delicious burgers and great welcome.

If nothing scares you, ask for the "Clovis le grand" burger and see if you‚Äôre up to the challenge: eating it all.
Here's a photo of Clovis and his burger: a man of legend!
Tasty authentic cuisine in a simple d√©cor.
Duck is this place's specialty.
I love it!
It's my favorite Chinese restaurant!
Most of the customers are Asian.

Rice with pork and Peking duck.
An excellent little Chinese restaurant, friendly and affordable, which offers a large selection of delicious well-executed dishes.
China on a plate!
A Chinese restaurant popular with Asian customers, that's a good sign!
Appetizing duck, fast service and reasonable prices.
For lunch and especially for the beef and aubergine casserole.
Don't even consider it, it's disgusting‚Ä¶
It's turned into a lounge, so the prices have gone up.
The onion soup is great.
The Sancerre restaurant tartare.
‚Ç¨5.40 for a glass of ros√©‚Ä¶
How can I phrase it??? #WTF
Ask for <NAME> to be your waiter, he'll happily serve you.
Very good homemade desserts, very friendly staff apart from one waiter who was a bit unpleasant, even a bit nasty.
A place worth visiting on rue des Abbesses.
A bar near Place des Abbesses.
Normal service and small terrace, but nothing spectacular.
Expensive: Coke ‚Ç¨5, Monaco ‚Ç¨4.50.
When there aren't too many tourists around, it's nice to sit down with friends and enjoy a nice glass of Monbazillac and a slice of red fruits cheesecake.
Frozen food mostly, avoid eating there.
The owner is unpleasant but the staff are friendly.
Very disappointed by the food: bland and tasteless.
A shame to pay this much for that!
Simply delicious!!!!!
Ridiculously small portions‚Ä¶
Very expensive‚Ä¶ at least the service if great!!!
Avoid this place in the day time, one of the waiters is really aggressive.
On the other hand, it's great in the evening!
Wonderful d√©cor, very friendly people, delicious food!
Try it very soon!
Very average service given how expensive it is.
The coffee costs ‚Ç¨1 when you drink it at the counter.
A piece of Spain in Paris.
Nice terrace, good food, perfect for a drink and tapas to share with your date or with friends.
Two minutes away from H√¥tel de Buci, this restaurant in Rue de Seine is wonderful!
If there are about 10 of you, you can ask for the private room on the first floor, which is very pleasant.
Everything is excellent, especially the burrata, the risotto da Rosa with belota, the club sandwich and the cheesecake!!!
Fancy a nice relaxing moment?
Welcome to Da Rosa!
Friendly smiley staff, great quality food and a nice setting!
As nice for a romantic dinner as it is for a meal with a group of friends.
Totally overpriced pasta (‚Ç¨18‚Ä¶hello?!); overcooked too.
Nice ham.
My first time in this place: the private seating area on the pavement is nice, the drinks are a bit expensive (the cheapest red wine by the glass ‚Äì ‚Ç¨5‚Äì is undrinkable). Don't know about the food. The service... forget it!
The private terrace is the perfect setting to enjoy cold meats, cheese and other house specialties.
A cheesecake with swirls of caramel sauce inside it to die for.
Expensive for what it is.
The staff are pleasant, the place is nice though a bit small and the tables are a bit too squashed together.
The terrace is nice but in winter, you're better off going somewhere else.
A calm terrace, very private.
Top quality food, fairly affordable. Polite staff. Excellent salad with very fresh and creamy buratta.

Good atmosphere, typical setting, and above all fantastic food!!!!
Great place for nibbles‚Ä¶
The service is a bit slow.
The iberico ham is delicious.
The focaccia is soft and very light.
I recommend trying the manchego cheese with membrillo, it's very nice and very Spanish.
The place is as beautiful as welcoming.
A terrace but also a little upstairs room which is very pleasant.
Good wine, nice cold meats, good service. A nice place for a drink with friends/colleagues.
