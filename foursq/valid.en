Chez Jeanette is basically the employment service of note for showbiz types in the 10th arrondissement.
Homemade‚Ä¶
Often crowded, the clientele has the barmen it deserves‚Ä¶
A neighbourhood institution where the hipster, arty and JCD crowds mix.
It's often full, so we take our beers outside.
This bar has become really trendy, but the atmosphere is nice and a drink after work isn't too expensive.
A classic that's in decline, probably because of the pretty rude barmen
The Jeanette burger is worth its weight in peanuts.
Hell on earth.
Actually really cool!
Ask the barman to whip you up a tabasco shot!
The Long Islands are wild!
Really good hot chocolate for under 3 euros!
Perfect for this weather and this wind‚Ä¶
Have a drink along with a mixed platter‚Ä¶
And the salads are to die for!
Nice big caf√©, with a lovely counter.
Totally hipster, which is amazing on this street.
Always packed‚Ä¶
Honestly, the food is not too good, but it's okay for a casual coffee (1 Euro at the counter)
Good for a few beers with friends.
Young and hipster atmosphere
Choose a table on the patio.
Bad experience on a Sunday morning: a pretentious welcome and third-rate service.
You get the feeling you're hassling them.
At these prices you don't mess around.
The meat is good and tender, not to mention the kids' French toast which is to die for üòçüòç
An excellent hipster restaurant.
Good menu, but half the dishes were unavailable.
Slow and disorganised service
Very original brunch with cotton candy appetiser!
Less than half of the dishes available (menu being changed the day after) but good service.
Great dishes with no low points.
I recommend the chicken with the kids' French toast. Superb!
F- Brunch for 25 euros, two courses.
Really nice :)
The best French toast
What you'd expect, very nice cuts of beef all day.
Reliable and efficient!
The red meat is a must-have: hanger steak, sirloin, rib steak and prime rib.
On a board with a good knife :)
Coffee for 95 cents at the counter, it's rare in Paris!
It deserves to be highlighted.
Good location: the service is slow but the quality to price ratio is decent.
Pretty good service for a Parisian bar but no pretentiousness and not pricey!
Go there right now!
The bar is the benchmark in the neighbourhood.
Its 19th century registred fa√ßade and terrace are unique.
The painter's bistro relies on Qywee for its local deals
My first experience was terrible.
Terrible service, the soup was like plaster.
But 9 months later the service seems better, (new staff?) although the grenadier was really bland
Speak informally to the servers!
You have to try the meat, dleicious! And the service is incredibly quick.
I had lunch here lol, how are you?
Midday menu appetiser+main course or main course+dessert for ‚Ç¨10!
Although the waitresses are pretty, the food is just so-so‚Ä¶
Avoid the back room if you're in a group, they'll put you out at midnight and let you know by putting the chairs on the tables‚Ä¶
Very good location with Mexican food, generous portions and pitchers of margarita ‚úåÔ∏è
Not bad, good quality to price ratio, generous portions.
Touristy, noisy, exchange student clientele

The granita margaritas are crazy (‚Ç¨6.50 for 33cl).
For your main course, try the chicken burrito; a classic.
Pitcher of maragaritas for ‚Ç¨10 and authentic atmosphere.
Worth the price
Lovely, cheap, tasty, generous and crazy decor!
It's becoming my personal cafeteria!
Midday menu from ‚Ç¨12, just like the restaurant: small but appetising.
My HQ for 9 years: a delight for fans of Latin America.
An atmosphere that is always great if only because of the d√©cor... but what's more, the waitresses are always delightful and the dishes are authentic
Young and relaxed atmosphere, you can eat well for very little.
I recommend the pitchers of margarita or pisco
Super atmosphere, beautiful terrace and an americano for ‚Ç¨2.
A pleasant pit stop in Le Marais.
The garden is very nice, perfect for a tea or a smoothie.
Remember to bring cash, they don't take credit card :)
The little garden is really nice even though it‚Äôs often taken over when the weather is good.
Nice food, excellent location.
The apple cake with cinnamon, delicious!
Tea and coffee refills and the homemade pastries are some of life's little pleasures.
You have to try the Swedish specialities in this charming paved courtyard away from the hustle and bustle.
Superb location and excellent cake!
The soups and cakes are delicious, with a homemade flavour that makes them unforgettable‚Ä¶
Lovely staff and establishment since the change of owner.
Tapenade and chips free with a drink!
One of the most jam-packed cheese/charcuterie boards in Paris - and good too!
Good French cuisine served well and not unreasonable.
Go there buddy, try the cat burger covered in cheddar and plus the steak is fat!
Very good reception/service, the good taste brigade confirm!
And on the terrace
Perfect to start the day with a good coffee.
Nice dishes at midday.
In the evening, good tapenades to go with your drink.
Really average, both the food and the service...
Really nice staff, very good food, nice setting and no waiting between courses: a great location!
The salade terroir with sauteed potatoes, dry cured ham and the demi-camembert.
To DIE for!
The tartare is also bad‚Ä¶
Small, very cool bistro, good burgers and beer
Les P√®res Populaires: music that's just right, credit card for purchases from ‚Ç¨1, outlets for your laptop and couches lower than the social security deficit.
To the bar, to the bar
Really convenient for working while having a drink in a good atmosphere, plenty of electrical outlets.
A simply great bar where you feel free and sometimes even at home.
No drink requirement, you can stay as long as you like.
The type of bar where you feel almost like you're at home
Cheese or mixed platter (with charcuterie) + pitcher of red = ‚Ç¨11
Too hipster for my taste, a bar that is nothing special particularly in the Nation area where competition is fierce.
THE bar in the Nation area!
Midday menu: appetiser, main course and dessert for ‚Ç¨16.
Delicious but poor portions.
Really the best bar in the neighbourhood, Nation, and the world.
I shouldn't overdo it though :-)
Really nice and no pressure to eat or drink quickly.
Not <NAME> but <NAME> does the caviar pipe very well...
******
Coffee is ‚Ç¨1 inside
Lives up to its reputation, one of the best burgers in Paris, and don't miss the pancakes!
Also, the burger is so good.
Delicious and authentic burgers, really feels like you're traveling in space, both because of the food and the service
BIA, the best US diner in Paris.
I live nearby, it‚Äôs always jam-packed with an endless queue, I'd like somone to explain the hype because the burgers are nothing special...
Such a queue‚Ä¶ but it's gooood!
The reincarnation of the Peach Pit in Paris!
Very good burgers, and an excellent playlist!
Good service, good atmosphere, good food‚Ä¶ it's like you crossed the Atlantic in two seconds (warning, the wait is long, come in plenty of time)
The Sunday brunch is perfect!
Unmissable pancakes and bacon :)
A culinary orgasm, the best burger I've eaten in France.
I will make love to the BIA burger again whenever it wants.
Very overrated by a lot of reviews.
Not much homemade in the burgers and the bland recipes.
You can find lots of quality hamburgers in Paris now besides.
A really long queue, but my God it was worth it.
The burritos are just too good!
The burgers are the best!
Fast service and pretty convincing American style
You‚Äôll be "savouring" an excellent burger guaranteed!
I‚Äôve got great memories of their pancakes.
I tried the burger, that was definitely a bad idea: artificial tasting bread, very, very bland.
I had to send the pancakes back.
Don‚Äôt be afraid of the queue outside this restaurant!
Make sure you get a seat on the bench!
The milkshakes are unreal!
The cheeseburger is amazing and the French fries are perfect
Unfortunately their brunch isn‚Äôt up to scratch anymore... Cold omelettes, disappointing pancakes... Basically, it‚Äôs no longer THE place to be on Sunday morning in Paris.
Great food, however there‚Äôs sometimes a really long queue, more than 20 min, but I advise you to wait.
Badass burgers, pretty cheap and great service!
Not many seats so come early and be patient!
Ask for the secret menu at the counter for the Triple triple!
Complete copy of the Five Guys menu (coming to France soon) and of the Californian chain In and OUT one of those absolute pilgrimages for any ‚Äúgraphic designer‚Äù.
The veggie food is delicious üòú
The veggie burger, or in other words a Double Cheese but without a meat replacement... üòÖ it‚Äôs cool to offer the option guys but at least give it a twist, otherwise it‚Äôs a bit pointless.
They‚Äôve got a really nice vibe going, burgers and fries with their secret sauce, it‚Äôs all good but nothing to write home about, still good value for money.
Milkshake meh üòü
The music was too loud and the floor was sticky...
But the burger wasn‚Äôt bad for the price.
An alternative to MacDonald‚Äôs with a good burger.
The best MacDonald‚Äôs alternative! 9.90 the double menu.
‚Ç¨5 discount at the moment if you pay using Lydia.
A great place with really friendly staff!
The burgers are delicious, the house fries are the best.
The + : the sodas are bottomless!
A Burger in its purest form, beautifully simple, fast and inexpensive.
The Ispahan (raspberry cake, lychee, rose created by Pierre Herm√©) was a must, but the meringue was too dry/ hard (tried 2).
Uncomfortable seating but a cute tearoom and awesome macaroons
Ispahan photo
It‚Äôs a joke, the queue, the price and obsession with macaroons. #scandalous
The liquorice macaroon is almost as good as the ones from Rue Paradis and Fashioncooking <URL>
The service has improved considerably and that makes waiting
An absolute classic, order a tea and selection of macaroons, there‚Äôs nothing like it!
You‚Äôre obviously paying for the brand name, but a Ladur√©e macaroon is such a pleasure!
The Ginger macaroon is delicious!
Go for breakfast, the hot chocolate is a delight
A really lovely Sunday brunch!
An original look and friendly service!
Followed by a nice stroll along the Saint Martin Canal
For a drink on the terrace overlooking the Saint MartinCcanal.
One of Paris‚Äô hipster and boho strongholds.
Great Long Islands and cigarettes for ‚Ç¨8
The morning waiter was quite cool, the evening wiatress was really cool
A terrible waiter who, when we‚Äôd barely finished our drink, impatiently asked us in an irritated tone if we wanted anything else.
Not too expensive, but not the friendliest of staff.
An ice-cold welcome!!!
Have you seen me at the boho place to be seen?
Expensive and not always the best service but great location next to the canal.
The best Sunday brunch out there.
You‚Äôre better off going to cork and cavan opposite
A trendy spot.
Always packed but really cool.
Really reasonable prices.
Go at least once.
Choose a platter or meat dish.
*** : A boho bar overlooking the Saint Martin Canal, a friendly welcome and reasonable prices.
A great place to go in the area.
One of the canal‚Äôs real institutions!
Quite good daytime meals.
If you want to bag a boho, this is the place.
This cafe has totally had its day!
You couldn‚Äôt have a better location and amazing view,
Good for a morning cafe or a quick afternoon break.
Excellent brunch if a little expensive.
A nice spot to rub shoulders with the boho bourgeoisie of the 10th.
If not what else?
Average brunch.
You can't beat the company of friends :) Having said that, an aperitif on the banks of the canal is always a treat...
A really nice terrace with a view over the whole of Paris.
Too much for an evening
The top hot chocolate in all of Paris.
I‚Äôm an adult and I‚Äôll do whatever I please with my little body.
A pretty view, very sleek design and New-York style welcome straight out of Sex and the City.
Great if you/ your guests want to soak up the view, the food is good but pretentious
Really nice vibe, as for the service, you get what you deserve, ours was good!
Very disappointing, apart from the view over Paris...
Very dirty toilets, off-hand service...
Nothing special except the setting
Amazing panoramic view of Paris, modern design and super romantic too.
Great if you/ your guests want to soak up the view.
A small thumbs up for the truffle and mushroom pasta.
The view is really worth it!
You can see the whole of Paris.
Go when the sun is out.
The cocktails are cool.
The attraction of this restaurant is the view on offer.
An unspoilt view across the rooftops and monuments of Paris, stunning by day and by night.
But obviously overpriced!
Ridiculous prices, really average food but the view and decor (Piano & Rogers + Jakob & Macfarlane) are fantastic.
Stunning view by night too, great service contrary to what some of the comments say.
A must for a drink!
Best Starbucks in Paris, sometimes a bit slow, but really friendly.
A large Soya Chai Tea Latte to really get the day started!

Freeze-dried!
Sickos
And if you find yourself sipping on a nice Frappuccino while Discovering, Liking my vid√©o "Hire Me" on the L'Or√©al Luxe Facebook TalenTube?
Don‚Äôt forget to Share it :-) #Concours
The staff in the new Starbucks located on the RER and Metro levels, are really friendly...
The new Starbucks on the RER, metro and tram platform is to be avoided, totally incompetent.
Stick to other options.
Exorbitant prices for dry, bland and artificial-tasting pastry and highway service station-worthy hot chocolate.
Avoid.
Really friendly atmosphere, don‚Äôt come in a large group especially in winter as the its pretty small inside. The staff are friendly and the drinks are flawless.
A terrace cafe with a view of the arch.
Ask for <NAME>, she‚Äôs easygoing and pays
Really nice place but staff aren‚Äôt on top of things or overly professional.
A restaurant with slightly absent-minded service, but still friendly‚Ä¶ You could put it down to the heat waves.
Under new management since April 2013
Very expensive restaurant for the quality (not worth the wait).
On the other hand the location is great and the cocktails are good.
The service isn‚Äôt always the best: it‚Äôs a shame that they decide on the dish to be served to diners without asking their opinion
Try the brunch, really satisfying!
The place is really original thanks to its architecture.
The outdoor terrace is ideal on a sunny evening.
When there‚Äôs a match they sometimes put it on a big screen.
A great setting, especially in the evening.
Come and enjoy the terrace with its awesome view of the canal!
A really beautiful spot but a disappointing food menu.
The cocktails and other alcoholic drinks are cheaper ;)
Stunning terrace, overlooking the canal.
In summer it‚Äôs perfect.
Having said that, a pint is a bit pricey.
A beautiful spot, really friendly service.
Reasonable food, a bit expensive and slow
Super brunch, but not the most interesting of restaurants!
But a nice setting, shame you can‚Äôt eat outside!
nice terrace for a drink/ coffee in the sun
Tasteless and flavourless.
We‚Äôll end up at MacDonald‚Äôs!
Chilled-out terrace and nice evenings!
Since the Bellevilloise took over the brunch is a must once again!
Great Tonkotsu (breaded pork).
The restaurant is really expensive in the evening.
I love this place too!!!
Don‚Äôt be discouraged by the slightly drab decor, the food is fresh, full of flavour and delicious for a very reasonable price.
Very good and superb service!
The tempura is to die for.
So-so and quite expensive for what it is.
Disappointing.
an excellent and authentic Japanese restaurant even though the area is touristy: a great spot
A really nice layout (less canteen-style) and modern, great simple menu, suitable prices but not always the most generous of portions (meat rationing?) ;-)
The weeping tiger was nicely rare.
Positives: crab noodles and the desserts.
Negatives: a cold waitress, stir-fry noodles swimming in oil, an overly long menu, noisy.
Crispy rice squares and incredible sauce! Great dishes for the whole table
Coco chicken is THE best choice at Lao ONE of the best restaurants in the area, get it with soring rolls which are some of the freshest in Belleville!
Get a bo bun for sure-fire value!
I‚Äôve been there about ten times, tried a different dish on each visit, I‚Äôve never been disappointed!
Definitely the best Thai restaurant in the area.
It‚Äôs really good but the service isn‚Äôt the best or the most friendly :(
The green curry soup is great, everything else is also good and I was really happy to find Beer Lao!
The jellyfish salad is a real treat!!!
The Bo Bun is the real deal!
It‚Äôs pretty good, a bit noisy and possibly a little expensive.
But there‚Äôs a lot to choose from, friendly staff and nice decor.
Get the weeping tiger and avoid chatting to the slightly rude waitress
THE best Thai in the area!!
Specials were a bit spicy grilled squid salad or the spicy sauce
Rice noodles with pork and coconut milk... that's where it's at, y'all.
It‚Äôs similar to "khao poon‚Äù for those who are more familiar with the Laotian dish.
My cheeseburger was burnt to a crisp...
I won‚Äôt be going again!
15% service charge included...
I couldn‚Äôt believe that I had to pay a tip...
1 tea 1 coffee 1 decaff 1 pepsi ‚Ç¨15.10 nearly 100 francs....
A relaxing break!
A place to avoid.
Terrible service.
The food is expensive and poor.
And what‚Äôs more you have to pay to use the toilet... unheard of!
A set menu breakfast for ‚Ç¨8.20 is too expensive: bread, croissant, coffee and range juice...
‚Ç¨2 extra for a boiled egg.
A nice way to arrive in Paris.
The service is too slow for a station cafe
Better than a casual bistro, but not enough staff.
Avoid the espresso.
The waiters are very ‚ÄúParisian‚Äù.
And the worst thing is in a station you really don‚Äôt want to be in a rush but the service is so slow.
Book from Thursday onwards
The Fada eggs yummmmmm
A brunch built around the egg
The only place in the area where you can arrive any time from 12:00 to 23:00 and get a table.
Good atmosphere and a lively place on Sundays!
Lots of little details would improve its presentation: the salt and dessert dishes...
Great but often packed (book) and quite expensive for bistro food
This restaurant is a disaster, the cheeseburger is bland and the cob salad is a random arrangement of tasteless crudites.
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend the French fries but long live the Thai tartar
It feels a bit old-fashioned, but the food is great!
We had to wait 30 min for a coffee...
Delicious roast monkfish, friendly service and nice decor!
Estimate ‚Ç¨20/ 30 per head, nice meals, nice setting, will be back!
An excellent restaurant! A lot of work has gone into everything, from what‚Äôs on your plate to the interior decoration made up of Chinese antiques.
The lemon creme brulee isn‚Äôt bad
It‚Äôs a restaurant, not a bar...
But the platters and the wine are nice.
The luminous garlands brighten up the atmosphere, it‚Äôs warm and the staff are friendly.
Beautiful selection of desserts üòä
Really unfriendly staff...
If you like snowball cakes, go straight to the rue de la Monnaie cake bakery...
The snowball cake lives up to the billing and the mini size means it‚Äôs perfect with a gourmet coffee.
We‚Äôll call in again to try the rest, Meo shouldn‚Äôt imitate Starbucks :(
The chocolate snowball cake is a killerÔòçÔòçÔòç
Excellent coffees, either black or in latte form.
I sometimes visit on Saturday mornings.
You can find great coffee beans there.
Basic cappuccino‚Ä¶
Plastic cup and spoon. Essentially, Ikea luxury‚Ä¶
Personally: nice place but the cappuccino only ok and I'm being polite
Very pleasant in summer as well as in winter
Innovative lunchtime and evening menus.
The waffles are unmissable
Patience is the order of the day in the tea rooms.
Savor every moment, you need to try it to understand it.
So much class in just a few mouthfuls, perfect!
A fantastic setting for a marvelous toasted brioche.
The Meert waffles on the other hand, very (too) sweet.
Royal service!
For the northern waffle.
Seasonal recipes.
The mini-waffles are great for a snack (The local waffle.
Seasonal recipes)
The waffles and the smoothies are delicious
Calm surrounding with good cakes.
Ideal for taking a break.
Completely shit service!
The waitresses are very arrogant and can't explain anything normally‚Ä¶
The ambiance wasn't great either.
Perfect breakfast
The place not to miss on a day out in Lille!
Very good but also very expensive
A pleasant tea room, excellent cakes.
Somewhere worth going out of your way for
Very good filter coffee (I had the Kenyan) to wake you up!
One of the 12 best cafes in Paris, with a welcome to go with it, the street is quiet, we're friends on Facebook
Advice for people alone: you are not welcome if you want to use a laptop (same for tablets?).
Oh yes, sorry - 10 mins maximum
Excellent coffee with cream!!
I go here a lot even if the owner isn't very nice and a bit grumpy.
A good coffee to wake you up?
You have to go to Telescope Caf√©!
And if it's nice, a walk in the Palais Royal gardens‚Ä¶
Excellent coffee, great breakfast, right price.
Somewhere that guarantees a good coffee, well-served.
A bit old school, ma non troppo, ‚Ä¶
15 years ago?
The veal chop with chanterelle mushrooms was awesome ;)
Nice quiet terrace, newspapers, good coffee.
Very nice staff even if they are hired for their looks and therefore often struggle.
Very nice dishes and in particular, very nice desserts.
The red fruits pavlova is out of this world :)
The penne pasta is excellent!
My favorite restaurant in Paris. It's good, it's nice. Definitely try the Saint Nectaire
Good scallops, very beautiful desserts
Beautiful terrace in the summer and a good menu.
The rib eye is simply delicious!
Like everybody else, I recommend the Oreo Milkshake, awesome!
Make sure you are starving when you come, that's all.
The rib eye is gorgeous, burgers very good, and the deli platters unbelievable! With a little strudel for dessert‚Ä¶ ;)
Best Yiddish diner E-V-E-R!!
But to be avoided at weekend lunchtimes as there is a never-ending line‚Ä¶
A particularly generous burger‚Ä¶ Nice setting, warm welcome, a good time is had here :)
Prepare your stomach before you get here, Schwartz's burgers hurt.
Never seen such a big steak in a burger
Really cool!
Delicious veal pastrami.
Schwartz burgers, a feast‚Ä¶ and with very, very nice service!!
Dynamic and nice service.
Better than its equivalent in the 17th district.
Delicious burgers and milkshakes to die for!
Worth a visit just for the pastrami.
Very nice and friendly staff.
Shame you rarely see the decor as the restaurant is so often packed.
Try the pastrami sandwich, it's to die for!!!
Ultra-generous, unfortunately, I couldn't manage a dessert :(
Good burger, but disappointing fries (soft and tasteless).
Moving to the checkout was very rushed, we had barely finished out desserts when we were pushed to leave, hurried by people behind us.
The burgers are simply enormous and delicious, especially the Forrestier and the Yankee!!
For vegetarians: the Vegi is great!
Nice setting, good and generous dishes, sometimes surprising
The pastrami is divine!
Ahhhh!
It's good and delicious!
Ideal American diner, very good combinations, TOP service!
I'll be back as soon as I can.
However, the steaks were a little flavorless
Pastrami sandwich, dry as anything.
Coleslaw with a solidified sauce.
This is more of an atrocity than a deli!
Products not fresh, I had stomach pains for 2 days after eating a Schwartz burger‚Ä¶
Best burger tested yet +++, but relatively expensive.
Good, expensive, service almost unpleasant if you hang around a while.
Come every lunchtime. The Bento is good for your health!
Best recommendations in Paris in a cozy atmosphere.
Stingy, you have to pay for Wi-Fi‚Ä¶
Seems you need to reserve before coming.
There were free tables, but we were kindly refused.
So in short, I won't be coming back.
L'Ane Bat√©, a spicy cocktail for those who dare
Nice cocktail bar.
Not too crowded, not too expensive.
Very nice ambiance, original d√©cor and great cocktails - 12/13 ‚Ç¨ each.
Service not up to scratch unfortunately (an unwelcoming young waitress in our case).
To snack from platters + cocktails served by an ECC trained bar tender.
Cozy place, service always with a smile.
Nice place to go.
You come to the Conserverie to appreciate and discover the art of cocktails.
And , what do you eat there?
Well, processed food, but not just!
The perfect pick-up place.
The soap in the toilets is great
Very nice place
The ambiance, just like the cocktails are top!
We go for the delicious cocktails and to stretch out on the sofas
I've never really known if you can eat something at the Conserverie‚Ä¶
If you are near the main shopping streets and you are looking for a place for a date, you've found it.
Cozy place, soft lighting, and a good cocktail menu.
Cocktail bar: 11-12‚Ç¨ for a really good cocktail with fresh ingredients.
Quite a young and relaxed atmosphere.
Highly recommended!
<NAME> always draws what she cooks.
She prepares everything at lunchtime. Lunch boxes that are making a noise in Paris.
An exceptional talent, who is just as at ease with battered pork as with coloring pencils.
The best value for money for red wine: Les M√ªres, a C√¥te de Provence from the Chateau Roquefort.
A must drink!
The cocktails are to die for, a delight.
The cocktail: Axoloti is a killer ;)
Prices that beat all competition in the district, especially at lunchtime (well garnished salads from 9‚Ç¨ and main courses from 10 to 13‚Ç¨!) Efficient service, good cooking!
The best, not too expensive Mojito in Paris
Unbeatable value for money in this district. Be patient, it moves quickly!
Best value for money in Paris
Always full, best to reserve.
Mojitos, rib eye, chicken kebabs, burgers, beef tartare
Our HQ to meet up with friends after work
Nice terrace, good dishes and affordable prices
Special mention for the Mojitos üëå
Inexpensive little restaurant, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe.
Typical French service: bad.
Overrated food, but good.
Good, not expensive‚Ä¶ but avoid the busy times!
For the mojitos and such cheap food..
Enjoy the terrace
I almost forgot: make sure you reserve in the evening.
Order the parmesan tartare and order it fried!
Nice place, chic.
Go upstairs for a drink or to eat.
Truly very good lunch at the Alcazar restaurant.
27 Euros per person, a price that is really worth it.
If you are near Saint-Germain des Pr√®s, take a break in this brasserie.
An original brunch created by a Natural Chef.
Gluten-free but really delicious even if the portions are on the small side.
As much juice and granola as you want.
Perfect for dinner or drinks
Nice place, but really too noisy.
The food needs to be rethought‚Ä¶
Good cocktails here
For the restaurant, poor service, mediocre value for money.
A restaurant with unusual d√©cor right in the heart of Paris, delicious meal every time.
Nice, but I didn't try the restaurant‚Ä¶
Anyway, the deli guy wasn't bad :)
Top Chef Menu: Yeah‚Ä¶
Book a "video" table or you won't get the Blade Runner feeling :) Try the Sumo Slim and the TaK≈ç Ceviche!
Very good and fantastic d√©cor, ambiance and price average!
Book a video table, ambiance guaranteed.
Get Mr. the Governor, the Crispy Ta√Æ Ta√Æ, Little Buddha and the Emperors' Himalaya for dessert. <3
Stunning establishment, very nice.
Despite the large size, it feels good here; you can hear each other speak, service is impeccable and staff smiley, pleasant and prepared to listen.
The setting, the food, an explosion of flavors.
Great music.
Cocktails delicious, food exquisite!
Really nice ambiance, lounge music and Starck design!
Really good ambiance‚Ä¶ food not bad.
Good ambiance and good cuts of beef.
Unique setting, very tempting menu and excellent welcome.
We'll definitely be back!
Great value for money and delicious food.
Try these: the Rainbow Samoura√Æ, the Mademoiselle Nems, Mr. the Governor and the Emperors' Himalayas for dessert!
The d√©cor is really fabulous and well-done.
The ambiance is as it should be for this district.
Asian fusion cuisine which didn't work for me at all.
Meals and Bobun >20‚Ç¨. Rolls (not enough for me) ~15‚Ç¨.
Get a video table ;) Good restaurant, great service!
Good restaurant, great service!
Nice ambiance, excellent service, the Mademoiselle style Nems are to die for!
Try the Mr. the Governor and the Bubble Tea too, for the fun of it!
I recommend the Solo Platter and the Emperors' Himalayas
On the other hand, wine suggestion useless but great service and nice d√©cor!
The dragon that moves along the bar :))
Take a terrace table, it's chaos inside.
Open all night and reasonably priced.
Delicious Milan Escalopes.
Too busy, noisy.
Worth a visit for the 4 cheeses pizza, but nothing else.
Very good service and not expensive.
Good selection for halal meat consumers
Tuna pizza isn't bad.
Best starter: Piccola Caprese :)
Good and delicious.
Avoid the busy times. Otherwise, very good pizza and pleasant service.
Very basic.
Those who really like pasta and pizza won't be happy.
A tourist trap or an option for a small budget.
Open really late!
2nd floor for the view!
Good, it's ok.
Good pizza and well situated.
The four cheese penne is very good!
Unless you are a girl or very wealthy, don't expect first class service‚Ä¶
Get Takoyakis for 4,50‚Ç¨ and self-service tea!
Free tea
The Takoyakis aren't bad.
Avoid going near closing time.
You get the feeling they want to go on a break in the kitchen.
Help yourself to water and tea :)
As much tea as you want!
Small and very, very good!
Get menu B: an excellent bowl of Ramen and half a Katsudon with salad for 10‚Ç¨.
The Jap with real Japanese staff (unusual enough to be highlighted). Ideal for those who want to discover a bit more than the endless Shushi!
The best chocolates in the capital.
Don't miss the liquorish sweets with Lakrids chocolate <URL>
The hot chocolate and the Mont Blanc are a must!
I heart Angelina.
The best mille-feuille and hot chocolate in Paris.
The best hot chocolate in Paris!
Best hot chocolate in the world!
Get the Mont-Blanc.
The Mont-Blanc, house specialty, made from meringue, whipped cream and covered in chestnut cream.
This caf√© is magnificent just like its cakes.
I strongly recommend the Saint Honor√©, the Opera and the mango and passion-fruit cheesecake.
Good & pleasant üëçüèª :worth trying üòâ
An African and a Mont Blanc for a stylish and delicious snack.
The hot chocolate is not to be missed!
The cakes go brillaintly with it.
Avoid going on a Sunday, as there are lots of tourists.
The tea shop on rue Rivoli will be closed for a while.
I suggest the truffle omelet or the Angelina salad which are fantastic. For dessert, the Paris New York is marvelous.
Special mention to <NAME>, our waiter, for his good advice and warm welcome.
The hot chocolate is a pure miracle.
I want to eat just about everything.
But I've no space left.
You should try and eat the cheesecake.
Very popular place, it would be good if you could go before 11am.
The African hot chocolate is good, but very, very sweet, almost sickening - Pierre Hevin isn't far away and much better I think - the shop is however absolutely beautiful - long line at the weekend.
Genuine Ramen.
Ask for the less fatty, less salty version though.
Arrive before midday for lunch to avoid standing in line too long!
I'm fed up with everybody saying that Ramen from Sapporo or Higuma is the best!
NARIKATE is definitely THE BEST RAMEN in Paris!
I recommend the roast pork Miso Ramen, yuuuum.
The savory platter, the bowls not very clean.
Oh, the hygiene leaves something to be desired.
Quit expensive however for very ordinary menus.
No thank you, I wouldn't take the chance. I won't be back.
The best Ramen!
Very good Ramen. However, go for the less fatty one!!
There is a line, but it goes down.
And it's really worth it.
It's VERY consistent.
The soup is much fattier than elsewhere, try the light one if you haven't before.
If you bring something pink, a free glass of Rose until the end of the month.
Check yourself though.
Very good pasta made in front of the customer.
For me, one of the best fast foods.
Get the prawn pasta with lobster sauce, it's great!
Very good pasta, made in front of your very eyes!
But, patience required.
Fast service and food quite good.
Linguine with basil pesto, cream, and parmesan: delicious.
Innovative concept, delicious food, but it takes a while to get served!
Although the place is packed at lunch, it's still a good spot to pack in a good plate of pasta or a pizza!
Go for the Scampi E Spinachi: a real treat at a reasonable price!
A great set-up.
Quick-serve italian restaurant that doesn't skimp on quality.
Excellent pizza.
Clever, quick, and convenient payment system.
Pick from a selection of eleven types of fresh pasta and twenty pasta recipes, or the dressed salad or pizzas...
The pasta here is excellent
Great italian food concept
You haven't seen healthy food like this before üòç
A safe bet if you want eat healthy and fresh on a budget in Paris.
With a restaurant menu that designates vegan meals with a little carrot, this is an ideal spot for vegans.
There's some wait time, it's a bit loud, but apart from that, it's got a fair price-quality ratio considering the neighborhood.
A really good brunch.
A bit slow, but not too bothersome
You can always count on a good, filling meal, quick service, and very kind servers.
With a pleasant atmosphere to boot.
The service here is appalling but the food is tasty and affordable, as it usually is at Pain Quotidien.
I *heart* the fennel tomato quiche.
A very tasty and satisfying brunch...
Vegan-friendly
Great place to enjoy a brunch among friends!!
I recommend the peasant brunch ;)
It's jam-packed‚Ä¶and not always enjoyable!
A nice evening at La Petite Maison de Nicole at Fouquet's Barrierre Hotel
I can't say it's very delicious, but it's alright.
You might run into Nicolas Sarkozy

Average quality at an exorbitant price. Might as well visit a real establishment for better service
Everyone should go at least once in their life!
A legendary restaurant!
Delicous dishes and what an atmosphere!
My dining party was all smiles
A magnificent restaurant!!!
The service is absolutely perfect!
Close to the Louis Vuitton store :-))
The best coffeeshop and the most stunning view.‚òïÔ∏èüíú
You'll find me at the Bar de l'Escadrille admiring Nicolas Roux's alias Buisson exhibit of sublimated florals.
It's a real pleasure to come across such a festive atmosphere.
Very expensive, horrible locale, I'd say it's a matter of personal taste...
Horrible coffee‚Ä¶
Wifi access codes/valid until 22/01/13 - the beef tenderloin <3
The bartender makes spectacular mojitos!!!
The waiters and waitresses don't have equal skills...
You can eat well, but the service is just average.
Incompetent staff, bland food, dreadful wine.
Slow service at all levels.
Long menu that forebodes nothing good as far as product freshness goes, no regard for proper meat cooking techniques, hardly any salmon in the salad‚Ä¶
The worst roast chicken I've ever tasted.
It wasn't fresh.
Menu items start at ‚Ç¨15
waited 30 minutes to have my order taken.
And I showed up after 2:30 p.m.
Cold dishes, surely poorly thawed.
To top it all off, the staff is awful.
DO NOT SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE!
A wide selection of crepes and flammenkuchen, and a few bistro dishes.
Not exactly cheap but I have yet to be disappointed with the service or the meal.
The salmon bagel is to die for!
Lunch menu: starter/main course or main course/dessert at ‚Ç¨14.
Good burgers, okay dessert.
The waiters have a cheerful disposition‚Ä¶and play GOOD vinyl records.
The waiters are first-rate, very welcoming.
Excellent vibe and cozy interior.
As for the food‚Ä¶
Deeeelicious!
I ordered the JD Burger and I honestly don't regret it
Great burger restaurant in the 11th arrondissement.
The JD Burger (JD=Jack Daniels) is out of this world.
Great d√©cor and nice atmosphere.
I suggest making a reservation.
C - I recommend their club sandwich, it's wicked!
The banana pancakes too!!
The place is so cool, especially the waiters!
The burgers here are amazing.
Please do yourself a favor and order one.
Good burgers, cooked through
Wines are too young but the service is excellent.
A great spot to bring friends.
They've got two, three whiskys that truly rock.
You've got to try the cheeseburger!
The burgers are very good, the atmosphere is very nice, the cocktails are excellent.
You should make a reservation, but the reception and the service is always on par‚Äì even for brunch!!!
Great spot for burgers and brunch!!!
Burgers just the way we like 'em!
Compared to average neighborhood prices, you can eat well at a fair price.
Quick service nothing to object
Good price-quality relationship and great place to grab a drink with friends
Extremely friendly waiter, very fair prices!
Friendly atmosphere, all desserts priced at ‚Ç¨6
Service is a bit slow but very attentive
Friendly staff but there are rarely any free seats‚Ä¶
My go-to: White Mocha with extra caramel ;)
For every person who detests it, there are just as many people who love it, Starbucks leaves no one indifferent
The caramel frappuccinos with extra coffee are terrific, with a salt butter caramel muffin of course.
Few available seats even if you inform them that you're opting for on-site consumption when you're at the counter.
The White Chocolate Mocha is my favorite!
By all means, enjoy!
The restrooms are very clean!!!
The White Chocolate Mocha is delicious.
Order a large and you might get a discount on a sweet treat.
The servers are very friendly.
I always order the same thing: large Vanilla Latte with 3 shots of skimmed milk!!
A bit pricier than other Starbucks but it's a nice place.
So it's Starbucks, so what?!
We drink coffee, we work, we put ourselves on display‚Ä¶friendly service, disgusting restroom
Closes too early and the service can sometimes be incredibly slow.
Service lags.
Dessert portions are ridiculously tiny before closing, so you basically pay a fortune to scrape up the leftovers.
The Tchakchouka from mama can be enjoyed without reserve!!
Cozy, quiet little space.
Ideal place to grab drinks and a bite with a small group
Visually intriguing, can't say as much for the taste, my burger was cold.
Service is a bit slow, McDonald's burger buns, not too bad though.
Authentic burgers.
Excellent place that seems to be holding its own despite the failed attempts of its two predecessors.
The kitchen's open pretty late (I'd say 9:30 p.m‚Ä¶.10 p.m. I'm not sure).
Tasty hamburgers and skewers.
Can't detect a trace of alcohol in the cocktails (the happy hour effect?).
You won't find much better in the area in terms of food.
Service leaves something to be desired and the restroom is pretty repulsive...
The Luc-Lac is delicious but try out the cilantro ravioli!
Excellent Nems, super fast service, has a cantine feel to it, open late, and inexpensive.
I didn't like the ban cun.
Fast and inexpensive Chinese canteen.
Well carried out considering the vast menu selection.
Canteen food: edible and not too expensive.
Poor-quality ingredients.
The lacquered duck isn't good.
The strips are roughly chopped and still have bones in them.
The lacquered duck is delicious!
And ask for a broth on the side, simple and oh so good!
Great and inexpensive restaurant.
Try out the beef luc lac and the banana tapioca pudding
Classic neighboorhood canteen.
Too crowded and too loud.
The quality of service is noticeable.
There are plenty of neighboring restaurants that are also worth a visit‚Ä¶
The best lacquered duck in town!!!
Canteen-style restaurant, but the food is excellent!!!!!
The rice Luc Lac, but also the pork biscuits, and the flamb√© apple donuts
One of my favorite Chinese canteens‚Ä¶
A Sunday brunch paradise for kids.
A trendy little Japanese canteen in the 10th arrondissement that serves up fresh, well-made, and nicely presented products.
The best chirashi in all of Paris!
Perfect for eating on the go.
Healthy, balanced, and chock-full of energy.
Nice relaxing atmosphere.
Not a bad place to dine alone.
Very light.
It's fresh and very tasty but somewhat expensive.
Miso soup at ‚Ç¨6 and chirashi salmon at ‚Ç¨18.
The bento costs ‚Ç¨14 at noon and ‚Ç¨16 in the evening.
Kind service, very spacious.
Good bentos!
Favorite dessert: the black sesame panna cotta
This restaurant serves fresh products and savory rice.
The dining area is very large.
It all comes at a price though.
Chicken bento is to die for, excellent desserts (the cheesecake and the carrot cake), great reception, small kids' corner, stroller-friendly.
An ideal Sunday lunch!
Resist asking for chili oil if you don't want to invite <NAME>'s wrath.
Reserve a table or order your food to go because the space is cramped, but margherita slices are for take-away!
Alright so the pizzas are good but let's ease up a bit, they're also extremely expensive and not all that large‚Ä¶
Excellent, inventive pizzas without being too over the top.
The place never disappoints.
I don't recommend this place.
The setting is really cool but the prices are too high when you look at what's in the plate.
One of the best pizza parlors in Paris.
One of the best pizza parlors in Paris.
Disappointed by their pizzas‚Ä¶
Amazing pizzas, almost like in Naples!
Thin crust and toppings.
I recommend the enriched Margherita!
Plenty of choice but no terrace! üòî
Ginormous pizza menu, prices are pretty variable, decorated setting, friendly staff.
Option of reserving online
Stay away from the two-person table beside the staircase, the bathroom odors and pizza smells make for an unpleasant combination
It's small alright!
But is it ever good!
Best pizzas I've ever sunk my teeth into!
You absolutely must reserve if you want a table!
Live out your pizza passion to the fullest!
New address: 26 rue L√©opold Bellan.
Bigger space but just as yummy!
The brunch is a joke.
And you'll never get your water pitcher.
If it weren't for the beautiful terrace in the sun, I'd write it off.
Excellent service and very friendly waiters!
For dessert, I recommend the pistachio/raspberry macaroon, your taste buds will be delighted!
Very cheerful and friendly caf√©
Nice meal, friendly waiters, good atmosphere, and chic.
Good place for a pleasant evening out
Excellent terrace and good cocktails
Delicious cocktails and appetizers!
If you're in the neighborhood and a sunny afternoon on the terrace sounds good to you, then go ahead and enjoy a cocktail or two (especially their cucumber one??? [memory lapse])! :)
The terrace is worth a visit, menu has the basics
Pleasant atmosphere and friendly waiters.
A big plus.
Enticing menu but the drinks are expensive.
F- 16 euros the plate, its terrace is a classic and wonderful summer zone
Cozy bar, nice atmosphere, somewhat of a view of the Eiffel tower
Too bad it's not open on Sundays‚Ä¶
Maybe I'll catch them next time
The banoffee cake is out of this world!
Good tea menu.
Lazing in the sunshine with a coffee and a slice of cake at Flower's is what dreams are made of‚Ä¶
No better place in Toulouse to stop for a refreshing afternoon break.
Just as excellent as always and a victim of its own success!
A yummy fruit crumble and a tea out on the terrace; there's no better way to spend a warm Sunday in Toulouse
Ideal spot to indulge in a treat or a healthy and flavorful lunch.
Watch out, portions are generous.
The right place for foodies.
Super good sweets, with something for every taste!
The white chocolate sponge cake is actually an almond cake‚Ä¶excellent!
It's just as good and has rich chocolate, almond slivers, and a whipped cream topping of course!
The chocolate raspberry cake!
Delicious pastries.
Price a touch too high
They've put jelly even in the cream puffs, the lemon tarts, and the napoleon
A good bakery-confectionery but not as gourmet as you'd think!
The best raisin bread ever <3
The chocolate eclair is delicious.
Disappointed by the lemon tart. Too fatty, not lemony enough :'(
The equinox is delicious!
The pastries are worth the trip, the viennoiseries are nothing special and more expensive than elsewhere.
The viennoiseries and baked goods aren't all that expensive and very good
The vanilla-caramel-speculoos dessert is nothing short of incredible!
Quality pastries at affordable prices (‚Ç¨5 for the small and ‚Ç¨15 for the large ones), all kinds of breads and viennoiseries.
A very warm welcome.
They seem a bit stuck-up but the baguette is excellent!
Recently opened up just a step away from the Candelaria, pretty cool since it's part of the same group.
Come enjoy cocktails with a side of oysters!
Williamsburg style
Very peculiar cocktails‚Ä¶disappointed.
Amazing cocktails, definitely one of the best bars in Paris
Nice place but it gets a little crowded in the evening
Try out the YOLO.
A well-balanced mix
You're best off avoiding the crummy cocktails and sticking to the wine menu
An "annex" to the Candelaria where you can enjoy - extremely - tiny finger food and a drinks menu that's chock-full of wines and classic cocktails.
At this place, beverages are the main course and the food is just a side dish.
A word to natural wine enthusiasts: you won't regret it.
The dish menu (centred mainly around seafood) changes daily. üëçüèº
The 3G signal in the restroom is a nice touch
Cozy setting to have a pleasant conversation at the bar!
There's something for everyone in their diverse, ever-changing menu.
You'll have to wait a while before nabbing a seat at the bar!
Delicious little tapas and inventive cocktail menu.
The deviled eggs are a must-try.
Plan on spending 40 euros a head to have a good time.
Great dishes to share alongside glasses of finely selected wines or true cocktail classics.
The panoramic bar in the center is really cool.
Delicious food, remarkable!
However, the servings are small and you clean off a plate in 3-4 bites: so you order more and the bill adds up fast...
Ordered an oyster platter, 8 plates of tapas, and just as many glasses of wine and were told to order something different or GET LOST
Great raw fish
Amazing crepes loaded with butter, the mound on the bar disappeared before my very eyes!
Mmmmm‚Ä¶
They don't accept card payment! Speedy service! And the galettes are very average!
This is where I discovered buttermilk! Rich crepes and plenty of choice
The double-stacked crepes are nice and loaded!
Excellent and filling double-stacked crepes!
Loud dining area and they don't accept card payment.
But all in all, a very good creperie.
Amazing crepes, loaded, but the place gets loud in the evening.
The best crepes I've ever had!
It's good but too bad they're victims of their own success‚Ä¶makes the service sub-par.
Very tasty savory crepes, well garnished and crispy.
Disappointed by the sweet one: the crepe was soft and the melted caramel wasn‚Äôt very smooth.
An excellent creperie.
Plenty of choice, sweet or savory, sit back and enjoy!
One of the best creperies in Paris.
Expect a long lineup if you arrive at 8 p.m. for example.
Delicious and a nice welcome
The only authentic Breton creperie in Paris, excellent and always teeming with customers‚Ä¶!
Try the buttermilk!
Great galettes
Quick and friendly service, great crepes!
Plan on spending ‚Ç¨20 a head for 2 of the double-stacked crepes + cider
Delicious crepes
Wow, they're the best
Good but nothing exceptional, and it gets a bit cramped due to the constant inflow.
The crepe dough is delicious but the savory crepe menu unfortunately lacks diversity and creativity.
As far as dessert goes, the Mont Blanc is a sheer delight.
Amazing crepes served in an authentic and original venue
The double-stacked crepes are filling, a little disappointed with the taste!
The "Mara√Æch√®re" and the double-stacked "Carnac" are simply delightful
The price-quality relationship is a bit off-balance, the restaurant is exploiting the name for profit instead of providing quality!
Only for tourists and foreigners with no understanding of French gastronomy.
Food is expensive and bland.
Aggressive, anti-white racist staff, disgusting food, excessive prices.
Go next door to La Taverne!
We only went because my mom's boss invited all of his colleagues, but quite frankly it's a tourist spot and not good at all!!!
Very slow service surely due to shortage of staff‚Ä¶
Great cuts of meat, I'll say that!
A great "caf√© gourmand"
Just perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.
The basque platter and lemonade!
A hidden, peaceful garden‚Ä¶
Enjoy lunch or dinner without breaking the bank!!
If you want to have lunch in a garden beneath the trees in the heart of Paris, this is the place to be.
Remarkable secret garden!
The small garden in the back makes you feel right at home!
It's a bistro as far as the food is concerned.
Typical cozy Parisian bistro with a pretty secret terrace (spring/summer).
Simple & adequate cuisine, friendly waiter, all you need for a good time.
Maybe a tad expensive?
A small token of appreciation to <NAME>, one of the waitresses.
Very pleasant and dyanmic place despite the annoying customers seated nearby‚Ä¶
Fantastic terrace, definitely in my Paris top 10.
But disappointed with the cuisine (starter: Cevice, main course: Steak tartare) Only the dessert got my taste buds going: A generous, delicious panna cotta.
This restaurant is very popular as a result of its small garden. This may explain why the prices are a little high.
Not bad but the dishes are variable!
(Try the dishes on the board) A great setting in the summer with a garden courtyard!
A terrace set in a lovely garden‚Ä¶ and a rare find in Paris.
But reluctant service and pretty average cuisine.
Original menu and excellent dishes, fast and friendly service, very attractive decor.
Small place and the tables are quite close together so thumbs down when it comes to privacy.
Nice place, avoid the basement.
Otherwise the menu's nothing special.
(Dinner: Two dishes and a pitcher of wine, ‚Ç¨52)
The steak tartare could be a vacuum-packed Charal :-(
Not cheap, but this beautifully decorated bistro offers great service and large tasty dishes!
I thoroughly recommend the tuna.
Nothing special / pretty average given the price / very mediocre service
There's a lot better in Paris.
Fantastic quinoa salad. Really nice terrace.
THE GARDEN's perfect.
Lovely setting, disappointing service.
We liked the garden but, in addition to the meat and tuna being overcooked, the waitress made an error on the check.
Fortunately we went through everything ‚Ä¶
Fabulous inner garden.
Located between the Place de Clichy and La Fourche.
The restaurant has a really lovely inner courtyard. A great option when it's warm.
Excellent cuisine and a delightful little garden.
Not the cheapest of restaurants but, overall, worth it!
Fantastic Japanese bakery!
The melon pan is to die for, just like everything else there üëå
Good ingredients with attentive and swift service.
Heaven for Azuki fans.
You have to try their curry bread rolls!
Bakery/patisserie offering lots of matcha green tea options as well as excellent traditional French pastries: Financiers üòã
For a sweet treat‚Ä¶
A real Japanese bakery!
Chantilly cream/red bean doryaki and fresh strawberry daifuku
A fantastic team and great dishes. What more could you ask for?
The escalope de veau montagnarde is like a religion‚Ä¶ and I'm a believer!
South-west cuisine, reasonably priced.
The Escalope de veau a la montagnarde is really worth going out of your way for.
Very greasy.
Doesn't take credit/debit cards, can pay by cheque.
Not good but fresh ingredients and not expensive.
Excellent logo, lovely waiters, fabulous menu and a terrific owner!
Nice menu but minimalist decor and an atmosphere a far cry from true Basque country ... pity !!
Former manager of Gladines (in Buttes aux Cailles).
So same principle, same menu but 10 times fewer people!
And they're really nice and really know their business!
Not haute cuisine but not at all expensive.
It's really casual and they don't take credit/debit cards but the servings are generous and they cater for gluten-free diets!
The best baked camembert, steaks and service! üëåüèª Very reasonably priced!
1) for the authentic Japanese food, 2) for the genuine atmosphere, 3) for the service!
Always top quality. What a treat!
Super fresh and melt-in-your-mouth fish with translucent rice.
Very good sushi at a reasonable price
Authentic Japanese at an affordable price. Really fresh sushi and sushimi.
The staff are very friendly and I recommend sitting at the bar where the chef is really friendly.
The sushi and yakitori sticks are excellent. Everything's made on the premisis and the chef's super nice!
A great address for raw fish and yakitori stick fans.
A real Japanese restaurant. Rare to find so make the most of it :-)
Tasty dishes, fast service and adorable waiters.
Very good cuisine in a real Japanese restaurant.
Tasty dishes and impeccable service.
A great discovery which makes a change to the vast number of sushi restaurants in Paris.
Excellent chirashi!
Very fresh but more limited than it might appear.
You have to order the sushi here. The fish is top quality!
It can take ages to be served but that doesn't necessarily depend on the number of people in the restaurant!
Offering authentic sushi, sashimi and yakitori sticks.
Try the grilled salmon skin sushi, minced ginger sashimi and duck yakitori sticks!
Tirachi with various fish.
Very good Japanese restaurant. The chirashi are pretty much what you'd taste in Japan.
The service is very slow and disorganized at times.
The half-covered terrace is really great.
Too bad we couldn't enjoy Happy Hour prices..!
Great for a drink but go eat somewhere else as it's pretty average
The coffee's pretty special.
Young and relaxed atmosphere!
Perfect to kick off your evening :)
Really great bar on Monparnasse :-)
A must-visit in Rue de la Ga√Æt√© which seems to have recycled all the Formica in the region.
Too expensive and no Happy Hour.
I really didn't like the food or the staff at all.
The salads are really cool!
And it's not expensive.
Just what the student population are looking for
Not the best cuisine, took too long to be served and meal was cold when it arrived.
Really great restaurant or nice to just take a beer (Paulaner!!)
For all my breaks between lessons or a coffee after school‚Ä¶
In my opinion, the best hot chocolate in Paris!
This is the annex to lyc√©e Moli√®re that's located not far from here.
Or perhaps it's the other way around‚Ä¶
Non-stop bistro until 11pm!
The foods good and not expensive. Steak/fries for ‚Ç¨11.50 and Steak tartare/fries for ‚Ç¨10.50.
Ideal for a quick lunch or coffee at the end of the day.
The Parisienne is really delicious!
Nice, good menu, trendy decor and all at affordable prices!
I really loved it
Nice welcome, it's pretty good and not expensive at all!
Good atmosphere except the waiters treat you like their buddy within the first 10 seconds and don't leave you alone.
Molo.
Great beer
The food's not good and really expensive for what it is, good young atmosphere in the 16th, waiters a little too cool for my taste!
Fast, good and not expensive.
Perfect for dinner or a drink with friends!
Cordonnerie closed by the authorities :( (08/09/2015)
Great!
<NAME> and her team know how to look after you :)
Closed by the authorities
A pint at under ‚Ç¨3 during Happy Hour‚Ä¶ What more could you ask for?
Good location but not the cleanest
The prices have gone up.
Pints have gone up to ‚Ç¨2.70 during Happy Hour.
It's scandalous!
Cheap pints‚Ä¶
And YES, great couscous that's FREE!!!
(As long as you can get a seat!)
Great place, unfortunately a victim of its own success.
Go early to get a place!
Don't go for the decor but do go to make the most of Happy Hour (beer at 2.90) and very large portions of fries.
A great way to start the evening!
Free mussels & fries handed out on Thursday evenings in the sumer around 9pm‚Ä¶ and what great fries!!!
Coffee at ‚Ç¨1 in the restaurant or at the bar.

The best Korean barbecue in Paris.
Well-priced and really good.
Avoid the barbecue. The little stoves don't fit the tables they were designed for!
The food is ok but the service (lunchtime) is dreadful. Barely sat down, we were made to feel that we had to hurry...
Ok, it's a baptism of fire but borderline rude here.
It has to be the barbecued duck!!!
Really authentic Korean barbecue.
Not the best I've eaten but generous servings and very good value for money.
It's a really good Korean restaurant.
The best Korean in Paris.
Inexpensive, very good. A good place to head over to when you're in Paris.
Not bad at all, avoid the upstairs area on hot days.
Top-quality Korean restaurant with traditional dishes and terrace area.
In terms of flavours, it doesn't leave a lasting impression however it is authentic.
Great vibe and cheap beer.
Avoid the bathroom if you don't appreciate brutal street art.
You're bound to get chatting and the drinks are well-priced.
The ideal place for a beer with friends.
Great for a little celebration.
Great atmosphere for a nice evening.
Music, oh yeah! :)
The beer's cheap, there's a really cool atmosphere and the sounds are great when the DJ's in the house
Good party atmosphere and great music.
Too bad it closes so early.
(2am)
Really great bar, good beer that's not too expensive.
Large terrace you can enjoy throughout the winter as well as the summer.
Stays open til the early hours :)
DJ's not bad at all, great atmosphere, but watch out for your gear as there are thieves on the prowl.
Don't come in heels.
The Campagne was rated 3/5 by FatFood
You have to wait in line on the left to order then wait in line on the right
The mayor would like to let you know that you can order just a burger for only ‚Ç¨8. You don't have to order the ‚Ç¨10 menu!
You're sure to have to wait, (the truck starts serving at 7pm) but the burgers are worth it. Out of this world bread, perfectly cooked meat and subtle seasoning.
Double up with a film at MK2.
Great burgers but if the queue has more than 10 people it's not worth it
The fact it's listed in the top 5 best Burgers in Paris speaks volumes.
One of the best burgers I've ever tasted!
(The homemade fries are the best!)
Located near the Mk2 and library, the truck has been a big hit. You "only" have to wait in line for 30 minutes so not too long!
And the taste is out of this world :)
The classic is a little lame, you'll like the "bleu" much better.
Too bad the pulled pork isn't available anymore.
Fortunately it's still blue!
The queue's not so long around 12ish and 2pm.
You have to order the BBQ burger!
While you're standing in line enjoy reading the latest edition of <URL>, the magazine of digital professionals
Hot chocolate, pastries and fruit juices ... to die for!!!!!!!
She reigns over an aristocracy of Guatemalan and Rwandan varieties, which she knows just how to grind according to their grade.
<NAME>, a chocolatier defector turned elite barista.
Fantastic coffees!
Drink without sugar!
Perfect for working or meeting up with friends for a cozy chat.
It's my favorite coffee at Le Marais.
The quality of the coffee, the very varied choice and the skills and passion of the waiters
The best place in Paris to drink a very high-quality coffee.
The top Parisian coffee shop.
Relaxed environment and tasting.
Opened until late, cool place.
Pleasant and simple place to have an excellent coffee, I particularly recommend their cappuccino.
Very good coffees, a super relaxed place, welcoming service and owner.
Affordable price for coffee of extraordinary coffee (‚Ç¨3 for the coffee of the day).
A real institution for coffee-lovers.
The place wants to be private and relaxed.
An impressive choice of coffee varieties.
THAT is coffee!
The only place in the entire capital that knows how to prepare coffee!
Since Macron came to power, the prices have doubled!
The legendary curry is perfect!
a gas works, very noisy, rushed service, meh
No less than two hours' wait for our dishes.
Even though it's rather good, you have to be VERY patient
In a word, it's a gasworks, or rather a food-works
A mythical and nice place, every time we go we receive a great welcome
eating in a station concourse is more enjoyable! It's cold, dull, with appalling service
Very pretty setting, but the canteen-like background noise is not great.
tried the sauerkraut, you can find better in other brasseries. ‚Ç¨37 with a small glass of wine, a bit expensive for my taste. Other than that, good welcome and surprised by the large size of the brasserie.
Latin night at 9:30 p.m. on Saturdays with salsa lessons


Like, hello?!
Go try the awesome tarts!
Sweet paradise in the Marais
An out-of-this-world lemon meringue pie!
The best lemon meringue pie.
J'y ai th√©i√®re and the Loir-et-Cher.
Amazing setting and really original decor, you feel at home, but the place is a victim of its success and so the service is sometimes not great!
Expensive breakfast deal.
Service is a little grumpy.
Everything is delicious but the waiters are extremely unpleasant
Very good goat's cheese and onion tart and vanilla slice, very pleasant setting
Quite a good brunch.
Quite disappointed with the scrambled eggs which were cold :( apart from that, the rest was OK.
The lemon meringue pie is good but guaranteed sugar high (then again, you go for that). Very nice place but ‚Ç¨12 for the afternoon tea deal is really too expensive!
Lemon tart to die for in a cozy setting.
The only downside, the noise and the crowd.
The best lemon meringue pie in Paris!
DO NOT GO THERE, not welcoming, the waiter refused to serve us, claiming that lots of people may arrive for lunch and we were blocking a table, even though the place was empty.
Often crammed on the weekend, so better to go during the week for a healthy and generous lunch or a nice afternoon tea!
However, the service is not that friendly.
The sweet tarts are delicious.
Cozy and pleasant.
Brunch is a bit expensive but very good, not forgetting the to-die-for dessert buffet.
The only downside is that you feel you shouldn't hang around due to the demand.
The lemon tart is amazing!
Poor value for money, ‚Ç¨7.50 for a chocolate tart.
Very good place with jaw-dropping desserts!
Incredible lemon meringue pie!
And very good tea.
One tip: come for afternoon tea (from 4 p.m.) to enjoy the deal...
Very good savory tart but a bit stingy with the quantity of salad!
I didn't like at all that the bill was brought with the coffee as a matter of course.
It's a bit quick!!
Very relaxed atmosphere for brunch.
Very generous portions, so much so that I didn't have enough room to taste their famous cakes!
I loved the lemon tart with a cup of tea.
Great for afternoon tea
The best tarts in the Marais!!!
**: Tea + dessert deal for ‚Ç¨11 at afternoon tea.
About fifteen teas and appetizing desserts.
The lemon meringue tart is monstrous and so it's sickly and a bit heavy.
very good place for afternoon tea, but not if you're in a rush because you often have to queue!
Try the chicken with Maroilles cheese, it's excellent
Quality service, and most dishes are homemade.
I tried the gratin - delicious and generous.
Suggestion: croquettes as a starter, and andouillette sausage with chips!
The chicken with Maroilles cheese is the best
The best Indian in Paris, without a doubt.
The naans are excellent and the owners are just adorable!
Perfect to take away.
Cheap, very good and nice.
I LOVE IT! üòç A bit expensive but the waiters are really nice and everything is so good!
Very good and for Paris, really not expensive!
The naan is expensive but good, the dishes are so-so
The cheese naans are amazing!
A sort of delicatessen where you can eat-in or take away, with thoughtful service
Concept trying to fuse French and Indian cuisine.
An interesting result, for less than ‚Ç¨10 a dish.
The only downside is the limited choice of side dishes and a waiter who seemed slightly away with the fairies.
Very good and generous portions.
On the other hand, it's also a bit of a mess to order
Super nice for a lunch on the go in the Marais
Best street food in the Marais!
Incredible pittas!
Special mention for the beef bourgignon and the grilled cauliflower!
It's always closed.
Such GOOD pittas!!!
Wow, the pitta garnishes are excellent.
Order the cabbage without hesitation!
It's good, a bit expensive, noisy, and the service is not great
Good but...
Expensive, disordered, uncomfortable.
Even the atmosphere of a soup kitchen would be more charming and pleasant.
Divine pittas!! Quite a few choices for all tastes (meat, veggies, fish).
Everything is good in this temple for pittas while you wait.
Thanks to the Israeli chef, <NAME>, for bringing this concept from Tel Aviv!
Also try the ratatouille.
Brought from Israel!!!
Fresh product ;) a bit chaotic but it recently opened...
Bagel Tom is THE bagel place.
Enjoy a COLTS or a PACKERS, grab a Doctor Pepper to go with it and it will make your day.
5-star American bagel.
It's quite simple, it's the best bagel in Paris.
A real New York-style Bagel Joint, with the bonus of a store so you can stock up for your next Burger night.
The best bagels in Paris!
Try it soon!!!
Good price, changing atmosphere and good bagels ¬ª¬ª¬ª don't hesitate to try!
The bagels are good but the crisps are industrial and the desserts are frozen.
You can have a Nespresso coffee for ‚Ç¨1.30!
