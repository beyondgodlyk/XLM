The Pho bang New York is much better.
Especially since it's just next door.
Croissants and desserts
Very unpleasant service, we were shown the door when we'd barely finishes our dessert "because people have been waiting for your table for an hour."

Good atmosphere on Thursdays!!
Pleasant welcome and unusual menu, the lunch menu is good value for money!

For Japanese food lovers here, you sit on the ground to eat like in Japan.

Very inferior to what I was expecting to find.
Great place, flawless and varied food, very nice staff and very attentive just like the manager, as far as diving is concerned it's just a bit stressful for those who like me are claustrophobic!

I recommend the local beer: the triple cauwe

It is a real delight especially in the morning; straight out of the oven!!
A smell that I love but above all a tayara taste <3 worth trying.
A very original coffee shop!!
The sushi-bar is great as long as you're at the beginning of it, because if you're unlucky enough to be seating next to the loop, you're only left with the few crumbs that have been going around for 2 hours and that nobody wants!
Nice go-karting but the 15 minutes often end up only being 12 or 13 minutes‚Ä¶ not cool‚Ä¶

Perfect for a relaxed evening!
Rather rare, this square is split over 4 different arrondissements (the 8th, 9th, 17th and 18th).

A nice setting, great service and most importantly very fresh ingredients!!

Kind of arrogant!
Tapas to die for, along with a flawless service.
Definitely worth trying!

And <NAME> is very friendly
Excellent shellfish platters and great service

The UGC card is USELESS: COMPLETE RIP-OFF‚Ä¶
(3D glasses [ugc, mk2...] not compatible with their partner, the REX cinema)

On the second floor of Docks 76.
Prepare your earplugs (very noisy place)

This place is shit. I'm never coming back!
Overpriced for what they served me!
May depend on the dishes you choose

The food is still as good but ??
Pleasant atmosphere except for the music!

Great service & good taste & clean
Nice summer pool...
Deckchairs by the pool, you can sit on the grass with a view over the river....
The best of all: the ice cream/cr√™pe and sandwich kiosk‚Ä¶ ;)
The exit down to the left in screen 13 is very tight #beaware
Avoid it at all costs!
The "paysanne" cr√™pe is disgusting and overpriced.
My girlfriend ended up with stomach cramps because of it.
Another Saint-Michel neighborhood restaurant best avoided.
Subdued atmosphere, soothing music, the d√©cor is somewhere between burlesque and western.
Between $30 and 45 for a main course + a glass of wine.
Pleasant service and creative cuisine.
But too calorific and not many desserts.
Very nice coffee shop, I love it
Indeed, the burger is exceptional.
The problem is the atmosphere, they expect you to swallow your burger in one go and get out straightaway.
The biggest turnover in the neighborhood
Delicious experience provided by the restaurant's cooks and by the waiting staff.
It's good to find an Horeca restaurant which provides such good service to its customers!

Try it as soon as you can!
Lunch available for a very affordable price.
Too bad an establishment located in a station is so slow to serve! 10min around 11 a.m. for two coffees and a pastry.

The Stewart Museum, refurbished in 2011, is really worth a visit!
try the savory crepes..... a delight!!
The dishes are just about ok for the price, nothing is homemade.
The service is very average, the craziest thing of all: the waiter has a pint ready on the next table and stops to have a sip whenever he can.
On average a 1/4 hour wait before a waiter comes to your table.
And if he drops by your table, grab him while you can
Their Flat White with oat milk (specify if you want a vegan milk) ‚òï ÊµÅËÖî is delicious even if it is not put together exactly like in a proper coffee shop.

Not bad, the food is good, but service isn't always clean‚Ä¶
Nice place to do a bit of exercise.
25m pool, and a smaller pool with moving water channels!
Big and noisy, pretty standard food. It's fine, but it's not the best.
At our place, you'll only find good stuff. Don't hesitate to come and see you, you won't regret it. :D
The "boyarde compl√®te" (with an egg)
Nothing like the 3P salad followed by the molten chocolate cake, bonus point if it's served by the pretty redhead.

Try the Nescaf√© range
A natural source of cold water
Avoid the fruit juice!
Stick to safe choices such as coke instead‚Ä¶
A little time travel...

Poutine fries (with cheese): excellent but very salty.
And very heavy too.
Go there in summer because the terrace is nice, noisy and smelly inside.

A mini beer to taste ;) Very nice! :)
The Po√™le d'or is well deserved
The poutines are worth a try!
Excellent service, the staff is helpful, delicious dishes but avoid the place at weekend because it is difficult to find a table :)
The ramen here are fantastic, definitely among the best in Paris!
Opt for the bucatin... It's a nice change from the pasta you usually get‚Ä¶ I wish my food had been hotter‚Ä¶ a nice place to sample Italian pasta

The pizza with an egg is amazing!
Avoid going there in the evening at the weekend.
The place is big but still gets crowded!
And don't hesitate to order sushi and makis, it's all very good!
The breast fillet is top notch!
A piece of advice: choose the ros√©.
Fast service, smoking area on the heated terrace and on top of that open 24/24!
Great for early mornings when you've been out clubbing ;)
Nothing like a croquette on the way home.
‚Ç¨10 take-away set menu with a burger (which comes with excellent homemade buns), fries and drink.
One of the best in Paris!
Paraiba!
A great day full of new discoveries.
Fascinating!
Excellent first impression, the waiter is very friendly and professional, the rest looks equally good

Good bistro cuisine, not very cheap, but reliable option in the neighborhood for lunch.
Thumbs up for the very efficient staff and the friendly welcome!
McDonald's is McDonald's even on the moon.

A place you simply can't avoid.
Don't resist the macaroons.
And make sure you're there very early.
Nice view, but very poorly signposted access.
Very atmospheric
Admire the great glass roofs and panels
Restaurant room upstairs, when you order the cochonnaille platter, you expect cold meats freshly sliced off the leg of ham. But that's not the case, industrial cold meats straight out of the plastic packaging which is not quite as appealing.
Morning coffee, sunny terrace, great service
Really tacky but the atmosphere is nice and the burgers are not bad at all
Nice meal in the upstairs dining room, pleasant service and good set menus!
The service is perfect and the new guy, <NAME>, is especially welcoming and always attentive :)

Just passing through but very pleasantly surprised by the place and the views!
It is here that, since 2009, thousands of volunteers have attended concerts by David Guetta, Sexion d'assaut, Busta Rhymes, NERD and many others... in exchange for a few hours of their time!
One of the most beautiful parks in Brussels where you can enjoy wonderful walks or bike rides.
Ideal for nature lovers.
And there was I, wondering who might come here to eat :-D
The waiter in a black shirt is as rude as they come
Yes, I can confirm, it's the best coffee shop in Montpellier!
Au Bon Coin is the kind of bistro you come back to regularly, to enjoy impeccable service, authentic dishes and wine and special prices.
Tip from an expert: the small terrace!
The profiteroles are nothing like in the advert
I like this place, cool, good music and with my companion it's perfect, the pizzas are as good as in Italy.
One of the only places in Schaerbeek where you can have brunch on a Saturday or a Sunday (except last Sunday of the month).
Very cosy atmosphere in this place which is very different from the Turkish caf√©s and grocery stores on the same street.
Don't hesitate to try their pancakes... delicious!
An excellent chocolate mousse and a motto that suits me well: save the water, drink wine
Incredibly slow moving queues‚Ä¶ a nightmare when it's supposed to be fast food.
To top it all, the food was cold!!
A fraction expensive, but delicious.
The durum with a free drink when I used to study at INPRES
It stinks of cigarettes.
But the place remains friendly and nice.
Whether at high tide or low tide, a paradise.
Now a "bring-your-own wine" place.
upgrade your coffee!
Excellent pizza, crispy dough!
The slices are by weight.
A little expensive but good quality,
Pizzas cooked in a wood-fired oven, with lots of toppings, lovingly prepared by genuine Italians (yes, yes, they even have the accent!), you won't be able to live without it anymore!
Viva Italia! : -)))
A very friendly team and a very pleasant trail
Order your birthday cakes from here if you want something unique, this cake shop listens to all your wishes.
Unique creations, my little sister loved it
Service okay but the food is horrible
This is the place where they put more sauce on the pasta than anywhere else in Lille (Mezzo, etc. don't measure up! ;)
The pasta bake alla Romana is to die for!
Opt for the chocolate fondant, it's fantastic
Very good pizza (especially the 4 cheese one) but avoid it on Saturdays
A small restaurant that doesn't look like much but is really worth a try!
Try the homemade skewers...
Great atmosphere
4 hot dishes to choose from and excellent quality
Oh! This place steals your soul because it is so warm and friendly. Ideal for a coffee after work, a little alone time or a moment shared with good company ;)
Awesome Venezuelan Arepas, not expensive, perfect for Sunday lunch.
A great welcome.
Beef fillet‚Ä¶ a real treat
Close to the Champs-Elys√©es.
It takes you instantly into the Japanese world.
You will have the choice between various set menus.
The specialties are definitely their sushi and sashimi.
Great Chinese chicken salad...
Which they also serve without chicken for vegetarians :) worth a try!
A small friendly restaurant, ideal for a romantic dinner.
Creative Mediterranean cuisine
Good sandwiches, affordable prices :)
My favorite Thai restaurant in the neighborhood, unbeatable value for money!
You really need to try the Tuscan platter!
Unusual, but not bad at all, tasty and original, good quality ingredients
Very nice Italian restaurant, very popular so remember to book; the desserts are a bit expensive given how little you get.
The meat is delicious and the fries are homemade!
The Pr√©-Catelan's good reputation is well deserved, the cuisine is refined and balanced, for example their delicious chocolate and caramel brittle cake
Duck specialties: ‚Ç¨12.50 set lunch menus; starter + main course + drink or main course + dessert + drink. Today's specials: rillettes to start with, followed by a very nice pan-fried black pudding served with saut√©ed potatoes.
Very nice caf√©
Great location to watch the fountain display!
Very welcoming, great service. The tapas are more sophisticated than most but very nice. The large platters and the king prawns are excellent.
A very nice place in Brussels where you're guaranteed to have a nice time.
The waiters are friendly, the drinks are not too expensive but the food is.
Beautiful view over the small dunes and the sea.
Good value for money.
We arrived around 2.30 p.m. and still got served, which is good.
Pretty average.
Neither particularly nice nor bad.
Traditional but if you arrive around 1 p.m., they've already run out of a lot of stuff
Completely rubbish, just an American chain taking the piss out of the Tunisians.
I much prefer the Zink, El menzah 1
Nice waffles and pancakes, probably cheaper than elsewhere on the square from what I could see.
Very nice setting, beautiful terrace, delicious food and faultless service.
Never disappointed!! The crying tiger, Hummmm: -)
2 "cervices" lunch (sic!); very good quality.
Very good service and nice d√©cor.
Far more sophisticated atmosphere than in the various Vietnamese restaurants of the neighborhood or than at "Chez Fleur", which is totally overrated.
Student offer: ‚Ç¨1 off the "integrale" and "grande forme" set menus!
I went to Le Carr√©, which is near the INESSM.
The cakes were nice.
But the service was mediocre and it was so noisy I wouldn't set foot in that place again.
Best bakery in Flanders.
Here, at least, everything is tasty.
Carrot and ginger cheesecake with a raspberry and strawberry juice ‚Äì a great way to start the day < 3 < 3 < 3
In the restaurant side, one of the dishes arrived 15 minutes after the others.
Second visit, in the trattoria part, a complete disaster: the food was served at the same time as the aperitif 8 minutes after we arrived and the pasta was not cooked!
A good latte!!
A small Korean restaurant (barely 20 seats inside) that also do takeaways.
A nice place used by Koreans and locals.
Minimum price, maximum culinary pleasure!
The price is the same whether you eat in or get a take away.
They don't skimp on quantity!
The owner is very nice, it's always a pleasure to eat there!
The coffee and waffles are delicious, the room on the 1st floor is quiet and a good place to do some work!
A very nice restaurant, I recommend it to all meat lovers.
Very busy, I would advise to book ahead!
Come and buy ghosts, mummies and chocolate pumpkins for your little Halloween monsters!
Saturday's menu: assortment of Moroccan salads - Tanjia Marrakchia - Drink - Dessert > Dh 69 - Welcome mrahba bikoume
Excellent gourmet restaurant.
Deer and venison specialist.
I really enjoyed the deer rib steak with vegetables and fabulous homemade gnocchi!
Old style caf√© - _ -
Really poor value for money.
Amazing, lots of different beers, very nice staff!!!
Great service, perfect, friendly owner.
Faultless service, very friendly staff, I had to wait a bit for my pancake, but they apologized quite a few times and they even gave me some delicious macarons.
Very unreliable service.
Friendly welcome, efficient service.
Some dishes are still a bit pricey.
Very good restaurant, very friendly.
Wonderful sea view.
The pizzas are nice and big/very rich but the service is not great and very slow.
The buffet is really average!
Best ramen I've ever had!
friendly setting but crappy service... too bad there's only one person taking the orders in such a big place, by hand as well‚Ä¶ badly managed!!!
Really fast at 4.15 p.m. Ordered from the ordering point and almost as soon as it was validated, the order was ready.
I would give it 3.5 out of 5.
Sea urchin tartare and cream of lentil soup with foie gras ‚Äì wow!
Not great at all, unfriendly owner, very poor service, and don't be too demanding, or they'll criticize you.
A very nice and very intimate caf√©/bar right in the heart of the Marais, the staff is really cool!
A kebab restaurant just the way we like them.
Typical dishes and sandwiches.
Good quality, flawless service with a large indoor seating area and a welcoming and professional staff.
If you go to the bathroom, look up.
She must have her days, this morning she was very nice #thehorriblelittleblonde
Very charming wine bar.
The dishes are simple (salads, tartares, paninis or soups), but all made from fine ingredients.
The tapas menu also includes verrines and desserts.
Not convinced. The first starter was far too spicy, burnt our taste buds. The ‚Ç¨100 discovery menu including only basic drinks is too expensive for the quality and quantity.
Create your own pizza!
They're going to have to make coffee a bit faster, I've already been waiting 5 minutes for my latte!!!
Tim Hortons rules!
Egg Benedict
Try the duck breast which is simply delicious!
The ugliest hotel on Mont Saint Michel!
The bread is also very nice and warm!
Probably one of the best bakeries in Nancy.
Their bread is delicious!
You simply have to try the Henri IV sandwich and the Nutella-coconut shortbread
Easily overwhelmed at peak times.
Parking just outside, sample tapas, grilled meats, fish, and local dishes...
The desserts are sweet and delicious
Best view in town, but the music's not so good.
Try the lemon tarts.
You'll love them. :) Yummy!
A magical place for foodies!
Eat in or take away, very nice staff!
Small and really delicious ;)
Fantastic atmosphere, very lively.
A varied menu with something for everyone.
Nice cocktail list.
Always nice to have a coffee or a beer while having a stroll in the sun.
Avoid McEgg!!: (
Good value for money, great terrace, good selection of dishes
Simply essential: everything here is good, organic, natural and activist.
Once in a while, and with kids used to eating junk, it's a bit of a pilgrimage!
You have to pay this place a visit and taste some of their food!
The truffade is delicious and the salads are nice and big.
There is another one near Edgar Quinet.
Plan on arriving fairly early.
Pretty disappointed.
The service is slow and not very professional.
We ordered set menus.
After 30 minutes, the waitress brought us 2 main courses even though we had not started the appetizer.
Great service and great food
Anything with chicken is good here.
This is the best club sandwich I've had. Fast and good value for money.
Perfect at lunchtime.
Best macarons in town, new flavours all the time - yummy!
Every bit as good as the Parisian macarons!
Salted caramel, lime basil and poppy seed are my favorite flavors.
And there's a new flavor every month.
Very good creperie, the service is fine and the pancakes are great.
Comps - > Chomps
Welcoming staff & beautiful decor
Tiny place.
Very limited menu but delicious dishes like the now famous pepper pork that I've been tirelessly ordering for over 5 years.
Excellent restaurant; ask for <NAME>, he will welcome you and will make your visit outstanding; the tiramisu is magical
buffets, cocktails, lunch, dinner with family or friends or even romantic evenings...
Worst lunch I've had in Istanbul.
Canned food, frozen food.
In short, nothing nice.
Come and taste the king prawns!!! The lemon soles and the cod fillets.
Phew! The pecan pie is amazing!
Very cosy and warm design‚Ä¶
Very affordable and most importantly very tasty!
Deserves to be known!!!
The lunchtime waitress is very nice, even though she's a 10 year old girl.
Excellent food, good wine selection.
Make sure you book or you might not get a table.
Warm welcome, I recommend the tournedos rossinis.
The lunchtime menu with its bubble tea is unbeatable.
Torta Opera, wonderful!
For dessert, the sticky rice balls with sesame are a delight!
(With Eric and Ramzy's accent): -) sesame everywhere: the eggplants, the spicy mix on the table, the sesame oil, it's all good.
New test: pizza ordered 20 minutes ago.
"20 minutes" said the girl...
Speedy delivery...
Plus five minutes...
The poutine, the hot dogs, the burgers...
Good stuff only, everything (bread, sausages...) is made on site!
The pan-fried foie gras is a delight.....
It's a pleasant surprise that awaits the most curious.
With its French cuisine, its menu which changes almost daily and its wooden trompe-l'oeil decor, it's a real favourite.
Pleasantly surprised by the d√©cor and by the quality of the service.
Everything is nice (three chocolate cake, b√ªchette).
The bread is very good!!
Excellent organic galettes: the galettes themselves + the perfect quantity of fillings; neither too much (which would make them heavy/in authentic galettes, the filling are just an add-on), nor too little.
Service a bit cold
A bit snobbish but the food and the service are excellent!
Very welcoming, great food, the waiter is gorgeous‚Ä¶
Great service, the staff always smile‚Ä¶
I recommend the beef salad and the scampi Pad Thai : -)
A very ordinary deli.
Really not great for the price, you're better off heading for the Chinese district which is only a few minutes away and you'll get a decent meal.
Good value for money, the ‚Ç¨3 spring roll is very fresh and very filling, the ‚Ç¨8.50 bun bo is really quite good even though a little more meat would be even better
A little expensive to come regularly but frankly it's worth it.
The meat is cooked to perfection and one of my absolute favorite things, a chocolat li√©gois for dessert (with homemade chocolate sauce)
A clean place with good service‚Ä¶
The coffee costs ‚Ç¨1 if you stand at the bar.
Coffee with hazelnut ;)
Excellent restaurant, divine food.
Remember to book to take advantage of the 1st seating.
Best fries in the world!!!
Try the Daim cookies!
Great cocktail bar
Great service and very good quality ingredients.
Make sure you try the taramasalata.
Nice seafood.
The service could be improved (table numbers are yelled across the room) and the decor is very down-market (dirty windows, concrete floor).
Out of this world sorbet!
They know how to serve beer, here.
It's not like it used to be a few years ago.
It's not even worth going there anymore...
Amazing place for dog owners and their furry friends!
Nice food, great service and lots of friends for your canine companion!
Would not recommend it, the waiters are unfriendly and snobbish, a bit of kindness would not hurt
The sandwiches, hot or cold, are like everything else: delicious.
The smoked trout one is great and the cubano braised pork is exquisite.
New menu, new staff, new prices... not as nice as before.
The all-you-can-eat mussels are back on Sunday evenings
Very nice wine list!
The merguez sausage pizza and the welcoming staff
New Wi-Fi code: 2310224557
7.20 for a pint of amber ale...
Not bad but still overpriced.
Mandatory stop before the station.
The bread and cakes are excellent.
A nice touch: the tearoom at back which is very tastefully decorated!
Lunch menus: ‚Ç¨18 starter+main or main+dessert; ‚Ç¨23 starter+main+dessert
The price of some of the cocktails are more than reasonable!
Surely the cheapest pint in Paris: ‚Ç¨3!
And it's good too!
Wow a nice place for a healthy lunch and a glass of wine!
Only thing is the service is a bit slow.
The daiquiri was far too sweet and the Caesar salad far too salty!!: - (
New sauces available
A perfectly adequate Japanese restaurant.
Fresh and good service
Tapas aperitif on Thursday nights
A friendly welcome, a polite and pleasant waitress "tetGarmech", nice premises, fresh ingredients, very clean, affordable, good location. Fairly satisfied. A big thank you to ŸÜŸÅŸäÿ≥ÿ©
The freshest sushi I know‚Ä¶
Their food is very simple but very tasty!
Best √©clairs!
A friendly waiter and a nice terrace, but far too expensive.
A bar with a great atmosphere, the bonus is a billiard table in the basement!
Dreadful service in a fantastic venue.
Too bad for them: the waiters all think they are at YSL's and hardly bother answering questions.
Book if you plan to go on Sundays.
If the answering machine is off :)
Best baguette in Paris -according to the city-
everything was very good, fresh and well cooked + a very nice waiter
Get a meat or chicken schawarma with peas + garlic sauce, white sauce and some chili pepper!!
Probably the best place in Montreal to taste authentic Breton galettes and crepes.
Tasty bread and guaranteed quality :)

I recommend the spicy.
Very good but very bad service
Good atmosphere with Man J
The best and biggest truck stops in the area.

Beef fillet with a very small Ravioli side, served on an enormous plate.
Avoid breaking your teeth...
Unless you'd like to!
Quiet and cozy place
The mechoui is fantastic!
A very nice brasserie ideal for lunch with colleagues or friends, fast service, hearty food, very pleasant
Plenty of ideas for Italian cuisine with a twist...
But I'd especially recommend the daily specials.
Very good service but it is really busy in the morning
Quick, nice, good, cheap, friendly...
In short, if you go once, you'll go again.
If you want to sit outside for lunch you need to book in advance...
Drive open 24 hours. You just have to be patient.
The students' favorite all-you-can-eat buffet.
Enjoy your meal!
The radio show "Musique Maison" will be live with guest DJs on Friday 17 December from 10 p.m. @ CHYZ 94.3 FM or at <URL>

Excellent sushi, attentive service, relaxed atmosphere
We had an excellent time with great burgers and a warm welcome!
3 types of teas and in teabags...
Ladur√©e in Bordeaux
A true institution in Paris, where you can try the famous Poule au pot.
The service is faultless, the prices less so.
The rest of the menu is what you would expect from great Parisian restaurants.
Really good cakes, too bad there isn't a bigger seating area.
The food is not really nice.
Very good all cheese burgers, quality meat and delicious Oreo cheesecake.
Allow the full afternoon to digest it all!

You can now order pizzas.
The students can also pick up a copy of the "20 minutes" newspaper.

Too expensive! : p

Awesome ;)
The homemade scampi are great, nice pitcher of white wine.
The boss is very unpleasant, even borderline racist
And my dad's one XD
Nice meat, very well cooked.
The service is not so great, though.
You have to wait 20 minutes before anybody pays any attention to you.
The single profiterole is a nice surprise for those with a sweet tooth. Ask for the meat of the day.
Expensive, bland food and mandatory cloakroom after 11pm.
The bouncers are a bit overzealous.
6 tables available here.
If you'd like to pay a burger from a kebab shop twice what it's worth, this is the place for you.
Their bread rolls with sundried tomatoes are delicious!!
It says iced tea, but it's Nestea.
Poor quality coffee.

The hanger steak with shallots is to die for! Yum!
Wonderful fish dishes.
Beautiful scallops.

We all started with a check-in!
Ideal with a stroller!!
Healthy fast food!
You don't feel like you're getting fat, it goes fast, it's ok, no all the seats are comfortable and it's freezing in the basement
To keep it simple and punchy: the best sushi and maki of the south coast : -)
You ask for bread and butter at the bar, and they look at you like you're from another planet before giving you two pieces of toast.
Fantastic service: friendly without being too familiar.
I highly recommend the Seville style chorizo.
Very good pita.
You must-try the parma ;)
Lunches straight out of Quebecois heaven!

Best bagels in Tours
The best of the best, they're all delicious and the mini cupcakes (which you have to order) are perfect for events.
You have to specify you want a china cup since the staff want to avoid doing the dishes and pour the coffee into disposable cups!
Very good Chinese restaurant, great value for money.
The rice table for 2 is enormous: unless you're just back from Kho Lanta and you're starving, you won't finish all five dishes!

Unpretentious, full set menu for 15 euros.
You only pay the wine you drink.

Come and enjoy the food
The red curry is to die for!!
The service is rubbish, it took an hour before we could place our order!

Wi-Fi password (<PWD>)
Horrible, disgusting, worst of all: they don't even know how to cook rice!
A feeling of deep discomfort when ingesting this "food"
I like the salads! :) the sangria is not bad either :)
Average food in an outstanding setting.
Be careful: even though it looks like a gastronomic restaurant, the dishes are very average for the price.
Going downhill. Half the stuff on the menu is not available anymore but the waiter is friendly
Very good overall set up.
Friendly family atmosphere.
Good quality of service.
Wi-Fi code printed on the bill ;)

Let yourself fall under the spell of this unusual caf√© and don't resist the temptation of a delicious white chocolate
Eh Eh Eh‚Ä¶
We had a smartbox voucher for a romantic dinner and when we got to the restaurant, it was tiny.
A strange feeling because the location seemed wrong.
Not much luck for a romantic dinner: we were next to the toilets
Very nice coffee and great place. Thank you! ‚òï
Lunch on the terrace
The set menu is absolutely enormous, not recommend if you eat like a bird!
The freshness of the fish & seafood is to die for!
Great for dining with friends, nice modern d√©cor
The set lunch is not so good.
Around the Petite France, you'll probably find a restaurant which offers good service, good food and good value for money... but not at the Monceau :(
Nice interior decor, friendly waiters, and good food.
The service is great but I wouldn't recommend the crab as a starter (not very interesting) and the lamb is fine if you're on a diet!
The ox tail was decent although the sauce was too salty.
The wine was ok.
The restaurant is too noisy and you can't stay long because you need to vacate the table! ; - (
don't forget to book, it fills up quickly‚Ä¶ it's a sign it's a good place
One of the most beautiful terraces in Quebec!
Service (owner?) more than unpleasant and totally insincere‚Ä¶
Dreadful (tasteless) and expensive food.
The view is the only good thing!
Run away and go across the street instead: to the Rives de la Courtille!
One of my best dining experiences to date!
The best bibimbap in the fifteenth arrondissement
Set menu under 15 euros, eat in (small place but really cute) or take away.

I recommend any burger ("hamburg√©" as they call them), fries ("fernandines") accompanied by an elixir (lemon soda).
All for ‚Ç¨15 if you choose the "little" set menu.
Perfect for hosting large groups.
Be prepared to wait 45 minutes for a plate of chiche-taouk.
A total nuisance, really.

They sell an excellent olive oil here
It's like being in Italy!
Music, accordion-player, everyone speaks Italian and is fairly loud.
It's a family restaurant, restricted menu, tasty (try the pasta romanof!).
Their kebabs are good and not too greasy and the sandwiches have plenty of fillings.
The price is not excessive unlike in other restaurants which offer this new twist on kebabs.
excellent restaurant, very welcoming, if you want to keep the cost down, choose the set menu, it's much more expensive √† la carte. It's wise to book ahead!
With @<ID> and @<ID> for #Yulbiz Paris

The food served there is French and not at all Italian.
I don't understand why they list it under Italian food.
The scallops and the ris de veau are amazing : -)
I've had good meals every time I've been there, I rested there after my walks on the beach, very pleasant and welcoming, very relaxed
Didn't like at all the way the guy at the till greeted me but the cook was also unpleasant, he barely sais anything when he gave me my food.

The service still hasn't improved!
But the beer is good!

Restaurant serving fine Japanese cuisine.
Try the tuna special, a real delight.

The food is not spicy enough.

Don't go there for breakfast: the coffee is served in an ordinary glass, the orange juice is not freshly squeezed, you get a bacon panini for breakfast wtf
The Parisian burger is an invigorating mix between a tartare and a burger.
If you have a big appetite, the mozzarella sticks are a safe choice as an appetizer.
And the Oreo Milkshake, the perfect dessert!
Every time I come here, I wonder why 4? lol
An aggressive waitress who asks us if we've paid in front of the whole room.
Was never treated like this before by other staff members, shameful, waited for ages to pay
it's happy hour from 6 to 8 p.m. so, in the summer, it costs 4 euros for a pint (or 5 euros for a long Island), in bastille enjoying the sunset... top notch!
Very nice, we had a great meal, the black ramen and the ravioli are very good
normal shisha 3 months ago at 8dt but now it‚Äôs gone up to 15dt!!
I've worked as a delivery man, however people behave with you, keep smiling if you want to have a good rating.
You represent the company, the customers don't care if you're having a shitty day, they want you to be polite.
Green tea Chai frapp√©, great deli.
Nice caf√©, the terrace is pleasant too, though it's a bit noisy because of the traffic
Test of the new "Asian food" canteen in #Strasbourg : EAST Canteen ! <URL>
Try and sit in the inner courtyard (reserve before); both the tagine and the couscous are delicious
Finally an alternative for vegans and vegetarians in Limoges!
The "Vegan" burger is great, and comes with side dishes, all for a perfectly reasonable price.
The waiters are extremely nice.
Try the salmon and avocado tartare, it's delicious, not just the tartares, the sushi too... yummy yummy
A must in the neighborhood if you want to eat well without breaking the bank...
The aubergines parmigiana are particularly nice...
A trendy and overrated restaurant... there are plenty of much nicer ethnic restaurants in the neighborhood.
Full of tourists but the Mandalay sour and the cold beer are nice, Thai and Burmese cuisine
A Moroccan fast-food restaurant with the best "kebab like" sandwiches: made with real meat (not that kebab junk) 10.- a sandwich plus a drink.
Cheap and very good!
excellent food and coffee
Remember to book otherwise you will not get a table especially at the weekend
The terrace is beautiful but the mac and cheese was not very good, it was too greasy.
Nothing like the Bombay in Ain Zaghouan
For ‚Ç¨14, you'd expect the dish of the day to be quite special tastewise and visually.
What you get is an overcooked duck breast with vaguely mashed potatoes: a total rip off‚Ä¶
Beer and German cheese noodles (kasse spaetzle) to die for.
A little pricey but I think it's worth it.
A perfect cook.
The service is relaxed or more refined depending on what you prefer :-)
Very nice ramen, donburi and curry, not to mention the chahan and gyozas
A magnificent place < 3 a corner of paradise, fantastic decor, lots of greenery and great cakes
It's nice but a bit expensive.
The smoothie is delicious, the croque-madame is top notch! 11.50 though, but there's a terrace and they have organic wine ))) they even serve aperol! :)
Aubergine and goat cheese mille-feuille, best starter and great taste in my opinion
Happy hour until 9 p.m. for ‚Ç¨4-4.50, even for good beers, the hearty couscous is really tasty, the atmosphere and the service are nice.
Terrace closed when it's cold.
Ideal at the weekend: good music, big tables, nice people...
9.90 all-you-can-eat buffet at lunchtime (except at the weekend)
The shish taouk is very average and the potatoes are downright horrible!!!
More than just burgers, meat and flavors wrapped up in delicious buns.
A treat that melts in your mouth without getting your fingers dirty.
Excellent cocktails and the sushi really looks... worth trying for dinner, the place is very beautiful anyway!
I've always loved this place‚Ä¶
The setting is original, friendly, the spare ribs are very nice and the sauce on the potatoes is awesome‚Ä¶
The best dorum in the area in a Latino atmosphere and a very original d√©cor.
The carrot ginger and apple smoothie is perfect to give you a little boost and the chocolate tornado pancake is proper comfort food.
The d√©cor is nice and so are the waitresses.
The dishes are very refined and original, the staff are lovely.
For dessert, the cinnamon roll gets my vote!!!
Avoid this place, since the new owner took over, there's no happy hour, and there's no service at the terrace.
And on top of that, he's bold enough to say that a pint should only be half full and the rest is foam!
All this for ‚Ç¨8 !!!!
The perfect place for a Habs game
Rubbish... the bowls of salad are disappointing, you're tricked by the presentation. It's pretty much the stuff you would feed sheep with.
Dreadful service, we were served by a girl called Emeline plunked the cheesecake on our table like she was selling fish in Rungis. Shameful!
The Spanish burger is the best!
nice but nothing special (with the "la fourchette" discount, it's affordable): however don't sit out on the terrace, even though it's nice when the weather is good, there's too much traffic on rue de Londres
Very fresh ban hoy, bo bun and spring rolls
The happy hour is really worth it, it feels like you‚Äôre in Rennes' Rue de la soif but with quality beer!
The waiters are very good at apologizing, but not very good at taking your order!
In Paris, the Yam'Tcha restaurant gets ready for spring <URL>
You really have to try the belgo and the pepper wrap!
Very good burgers and hot dogs, with homemade fries on the side if you wish, it's delicious and the prices are very reasonable.
A very nice bar I've discovered recently.
The staff is really welcoming, the cacha√ßa list is impressive and the mix is very pleasant
A "parfait" and a "big tasty", the best of all burgers
What you'd expect from a Swiss place... very clean... latte + Brownie, it's delicious!!! (only downside is you can't sit down.. You mustn't forget you're still in Tunisia ‚Äì lol)
Try the sesame edamame, it's very good. Otherwise the atmosphere is chic with a LGBT feel....
A classic place where you can eat a very nice pitta sandwich with a Leffe but surrounded by tourists.
It's still is very nice and friendly, whether you're on a date or with a group
Bobuns (and bibimbap) with a twist.
4 different recipes including a vegetarian one, some of them change daily.
The marinated pork belly is particularly nice.
It's very good, it's very beautiful: 11
A real culinary experience!
The degustation menu is a must... Not to mention the desserts‚Ä¶ :) It was a real treat!
Wi-Fi down today...
Nice platter to share: olive tapenade, cold meats, mozzarella and vegetables!
The bagels are delicious here!
Here, the bagels are marvelous!
One of the few caf√©s where the terrace stays in the sun until 8.30pm, too bad the waitress is really unpleasant!
Let's hope they'll get a different one soon!
The portions of fried rice (whichever one you pick) are really (really!) big.
One is really enough for two.
The rice noodles are very tasty and full of flavor, I don't understand the previous comments!
apple juice, apple lychee and the Aubaine croissant
The service is very slow!
Not very convenient for a fast food restaurant!
Very nice beer!
The lamb burger is amazing.
churros = upset stomach the next day!! very disappointed
A good selection of bubble tea and very nice
Ramen, katsu don, yakisoba...
Nice proper Japanese food in Paris
I broke my record again last night. Five soups, one of which was a double. I recommend this restaurant.
Maki, sushi, yakitori, everything is nice : D
Hello my friends, in fact McDonald's is ready-made food. If you don't want to step into your kitchen all the time, please visit McDonald's. Thank you!
The best steakhouse in Sousse, you must try it if you're in the neighborhood.
They also serve wine here :)
Halfway between Robespierre and Porte de Montreuil tube stations, it specializes in burgers & bagels (the place next door which belongs to the same chain serves salads).
Homemade, sensible prices, fast service
Very nice pizza. I bought one, you can also take it away. I'll go again.
A decent restaurant for a phnom penh soup ;).
It is open until very late at night :)
In love with Cheesecake Side < 3 < 3, the prices are reasonable ("small pieces" for 1 dt only per piece, large cheesecake as on the photo for 20 dt and it's really delicious!! < 3 < 3
Stay away from the Caesar salad.
Avoid the Caesar salad.
The burger is just about ok.
Not really the best place in the neighborhood.
A new place in Kenitra, spacious, nice food and very good service.
Don't hesitate to try it with your family and friends
Good sushi, I recommend the chirashi!
Always a queue, the cashier is not very bright and there a $5 minimum for e-payments! Argh!
The mango duck is divine as is the pina colada
The steakhouse is worth a visit

Tonight was a special Brazilian night with dancers, music and food
Ah the small colourful stripy box, an invitation to travel and lust?
Get the famous striped square box, an invitation to lust...
A nice traditional northern France caf√© just like we like them!
Recommended to all ch'tis who like good home-cooked food!
Waiter!!!!
Beautiful, quiet, the best coffee, not to mention the grilled cheese with apple and cheddar... An absolutely perfect neighborhood caf√©!
The California rolls are not bad, although they‚Äôre a bit too big, and they have too many sesame seeds...
The specialties are great... especially the hot rolls and the crispy rolls!
The lunch platters are quite nice; the "paysannes" one are very filling.
Ask for the hollandaise sauce on the side otherwise, most of the time, it dries out in the cassolette
Perfect caliente atmosphere for an evening with friends and a second date ;)
The tandoori chicken chapatti is a must... for ‚Ç¨3.50
As it happens, they serve food but you can decide to simply quench your thirst with mojitos and caipirinha
new fast food concept store, Tokyo-style, excellent sushi, flawless service, you must try it soon
Excellent bobun, loc lac rice, big or small spring rolls, and grilled beef skewers
Try the half and half!
Everything is nice at Cirio anyway, including the atmosphere!
Friendly bar with an affordable menu :) Nice dishes (crispy chicken salad).
Go there one evening for a beer or a cocktail
Pure luxury. Cheap and much nicer than a sushi shop.
We are at the Resto Chef Caf√© for a bilingual office computing training workshop, eating a deluxe poutine!
The burgers are all very nice and you must absolutely try the Oreo tiramisu, it's to die for! ; -)
Will you be able to finish m√©m√©'s burger? The prices are a bit high but you can get a 30% discount via LaFourchette.
Very nice Korean restaurant: try the tartare and the fried noodles and order the delicious barbecue duck as a main course!
it's very nice and the owner is friendly and generous!
I highly recommend it.
Expensive and well below standard.
As they didn't have veggie balls, I ordered a bulgur tabbouleh (replaced with quinoa), the strawberries were too ripe and the rest (tomato, feta, salmon) was not very good quality.
The best restaurant for lok lak beef and rice or for noodle soups, though the dim sum is not great
It's really cool, it just opened and it's great *-* great service even if it‚Äôs a bit slow (they're only starting), the food is just fantastic <3 <3
Fondue dishes all the way though: from fondue savoyarde or fondue bourguignonne to chocolate fondue for dessert, it's really delicious!!!
The savory dishes are to die for but there's nothing Italian about the desserts apart from the ice cream and tiramisu!
The tandoori chicken kebab is excellent
Good pizza place in the center: the equivalent of East Mamma in Lille : -)
A quiet caf√© ideal for working.
Across from the general treasury.
Wi-Fi code: <PWD>
fantastic sandwiches with potatoes, grilled chicken, Toulouse sausage, ham, andouillette, worth the detour, very friendly young manager
Lemonade for 1dt mouch 5ayba
I'm a true fish and chip lover, I was very disappointed.
There were too many breadcrumbs on the fish fillet.
Fast food restaurant atmosphere.
Let's say 5/10, I still had a nice time
Great place, very helpful and welcoming, PROPER savoury pancakes!
My favourite is the "Fermi√®re".
Not to mention the bagels, the smoothies with no added sugar, and the homemade desserts and tarts.
A bit unusual today, 2 of the owners are serving.
Is it to show off?
They seem competent enough, but I think they'd better hire a few people
A bit of a wait, but it's really worth it.
Big portions, the shio/shoyu soups work well with the roasted chashu.
Two small shrimp/ginger fritters, original in a ramen.
A very small outlet that sells delicious bubble tea to go, wide choice of flavours and cheap.
For connoisseurs, they also make a really nice c√† ph√™ sa ƒë√° (Vietnamese iced coffee).
Very very good, I tried the escalope parmigiana (excellent) as well as the breaded escalope (very big), if you have a sweet tooth, I recommend the Nutella tiramisu, yummy!!!
It‚Äôs a nice place for a meal or just for a coffee :) the dishes are very good and the cakes are delicious :)
very disappointed with my experience at Zina's!!! I ordered shrimp briwats and I found a 1.5cm ball of foil in them; I ordered pasta and it was overcooked.
Disgusting eating and cooking areas, service as slow as it is unfriendly.... today it was the soda machine that wasn't working... eating rooms and kitchen really dirty, service as slow as unfriendly‚Ä¶
Never saw any of the employees smile.
Has anyone ever seen a friendly cashier in the Ile-des-S≈ìurs Subway?
I don't think they exist.
Souffl√© + Mocha = perfect combination
Excellent Asian restaurant: the ravioli and tempura shrimp are great!!
A nice touch: you write down on a sheet of paper the dishes you want and they are brought to your table
A nice surprise, article at <URL>
Beware and expect the worst: the live bands can be painfully amateurish!
Excellent service! Very low prices, very nice coffee in a quiet location.
Best place for a cup of coffee! :D Wi-Fi code: <PWD>
1 salad or 1 pasta box offered after 12 meals.
Don't hesitate to pick up your loyalty card!
Try the apple pie milk shake!
Everything is good here, be prepared to queue at the weekend!
Nice restaurant, fresh products & menus that change with the seasons. Very welcoming!
Very welcoming as always, long live Fathia and Jama, the best masseuses in Paris :)
Very trendy with interesting lighting... perfect for a special date... A real trendy place for a unique date
THE best ice cream parlour in Annecy!
If you love ice cream, I suggest: speculoos, Bulgarian yoghurt, salted butter caramel, raspberry, lemon and dark chocolate!
Great service and entertainment
Located just a stone's throw away from the Eiffel Tower, this Indian restaurant offers ‚Ç¨10 lunch menus every day of the week!
Time to enjoy the chicken curry, pakoras and raita!
The chicken burger is way more exciting than the regular burger!
I don't recommend this place at all. The portions are tiny and the service is really slow. I had to wait 1h30 for very average food
Not impressed by the burger, usually I expect a distinct flavor, something different about a cheeseburger, as every place has its special recipe.
This burger is way too average!
‚Ç¨15.50 daily menu. Today steak with shallot‚Ä¶ I chose spaghetti as a side. A half bottle of vittel and coffee...
Your 10th coffee is free with the FidMe app :)
nice food but the waiter who looks like Jim's father in American Pie is a moron. Always very unpleasant : (
The Wi-Fi and the royal crispy bacon
Cheap cocktails in the neighbourhood
The decor is modern and colorful.
The lunch set menus are very affordable.
On top of the main course served with rice, you'll get a wonton soup and egg rolls.
A glass of Saint Est√®phe, a cream of pumpkin soup and grilled chicken, after pottering around the Paul Bert, Dauphine and Biron markets.
Croissants, pita, burek.
Last day of business today.
Great pizza place, the "p'tite galou" is delicious!!
Shitty service, wmekla taayef.
Definitely not recommended.
Everything: the service, the Wi-Fi, the setting, the exceptional quality of the food (I recommend the seafood spaghetti but be careful it's spicy), the free tea and more than anything else the fact that everyone is smiling
Escapism in Montreal: very nice poke, friendly personnel, very cool decor that makes you feel like you've traveled to Hawaii!
The egg rolls are not bad at all
Average service, tasteless kebabs, quite expensive, when I see people who rank it as one of the best simply because they make cheese nans, it makes me laugh!
I have a smart gps, it makes me get out at Waremme and take the Chauss√©e Romaine to get home, according to my gps it's quicker than going through Lincent.???!!!
That suckling pig was really very nice. Usually the daily specials are pretty good and fresh.
Delicious pizzas in a tikki atmosphere... I recommend it!
One of the best caf√©s in Tunisia, really chic
Sickening smell there for the last two months... but free and unlimited Wi-Fi.
Ready-made sandwiches, ideal for a quick mess-free lunch
If it's your first time here, choose the Thali or the mixed grill.
And don't hesitate to order several kinds of bread.
Not far from R√©publique, a truly healthy fast food restaurant.
Very friendly service, the place is a bit noisy though, affordable food but lacking originality in my opinion
Original to try African fast food.
But quite heavy
The French burger is delicious, accompanied with a salad and b√©arnaise sauce, it's a safe bet
To do before Saturday: stock up on loyalty cards as the owner has announced that the prices will shoot up after the refurbishment.
The blue cheese burger is nice, the blue cheese sauce is original but could do with having a stronger taste.
Disappointing: ordinary frozen fries.
Everyone makes burgers, it's the extra fillings and side dishes that can make a difference.
Excellent Italian and Asian food.
Very large portions, possibility to get a doggy bag (almost mandatory).
Only open at lunchtime.
Very tasty and helpful staff.
Even though the restaurant only opens at 11:45 a.m., it's possible to go in from 11:00 a.m. to order take-aways.
it's small, it's good, it's nice, it's everything we like! we tried the homemade ravioli for 15 euros, nice big plate, we tried the caf√© gourmand or everything is home-baked!
Excellent restaurant/bar with very attentive staff.
The Ben's Caf√© partnered with Qywee for their local deals.
The blue mojito is smooth and refreshing.
The Nutella and hazelnut pancake is appetizing.
The banana split was nice but the chocolate sauce was missing.
You absolutely have to try the bun nem salad.
It's delicious!!!!
My favorite is the seafood pizza, crusty of course.
Rich, nice and light at the same time, a real treat.
Very good value breakfast set menus.
A bistro d√©cor for cinema lovers, a bit kitsch, fast service and the pasta... yum slurp!
Their veggie used to be better, but it's the best place for a bite to eat before a movie (5min. away from the Kinepolis).
Very welcoming, the set menu during the "Resto Days" event was very nice.
Pleasant and attentive staff.
Small parking lot just outside.
The best tea room in Paris, the Saint Honor√© and the macarons are highly recommended
Very good burgers, but one of the waitresses is extremely rude!!
She openly mocked my friend's food allergies (thinking none of us spoke French)! Very disrespectful!
for the Linen Chest
You absolutely have to try the pulled pork burger!
Very nice piadini concept (a kind of souvlaki with thin pizza dough).
Straightforward set menus and decent prices.
Not so keen on the tiramis√π, but I'm very picky when it comes to tiramis√π!
Disappointed for the 2nd time! The molten chocolate cake was rubbish, just ordinary homemade cake, no molten chocolate. My friend ordered a waffle with dark chocolate sauce rather than nutella but she got nutella anyway!!
Galette des rois ‚Äì I'm in love
The king crab was excellent but the service is really not good enough for this kind of place
Ah, the bullier burger washed down with a nice Pic Saint Loup, it was bliss!
recommended by Les 3 s≈ìurs! a bit pricey in the evening. bubble tea.
cute cozy CHEAP caf√©!
Beautiful decor, great atmosphere; the speck pasta is worth a special mention, it was really delicious!
This place serves very nice pizzas and nice makloub and you must try the cornets; I go there almost every Saturday. Well done to the whole team!
Best cheesecake I've had in a very long time!
Happy hour from 5 p.m., a pint for ‚Ç¨4.50
Excellent bo bun, but watch it the egg rolls are a bit peculiar (stuffed with taro I think)
You definitely must try the pistachio milkshake... The service's not so good though‚Ä¶
I don't know it but I like it :) not very objective, is it? Lol
All-you-can-eat deal for dim sum lovers!
Steamed, fried and grilled, a real treat!
The waiters are kind and attentive :)
A little gem in Bagneux, √† la carte or all-you-can-eat meal deals, delicious, affordable and the owner is a lovely lady‚Ä¶don't hesitate to try it.
The chef invites you to enjoy: a seasonal menu from Monday 3 to Saturday 8 March 2014 * * * Sea bream fillet on a bed of green asparagus served with squid ink fettuccini, citrus sauce and seasonal vegetables
A benchmark for restaurants in the port Marianne district!
I would rank it as a semi-gastronomic restaurant, subtle blend of flavors, I recommend booking as it gets full pretty quickly
So much more than a sandwich place unlike what's listed on the apps.
A true Aladdin cave for all foodies!
These bloody senile old people who drink free coffee: @ There's one who farts next to you and Jesus Christ, it fucking smells like rotten eggs!
Unfinished bottle of wine?
You can take it with you at no extra charge.
The menu is quite restricted but the dishes are refined and fragrant.
Try the iced Irish coffee: delicious!
friendly staff, cozy place it doesn't look like much from outside, nice food
hmmm delicious!! Ask them to spice up your pad thai a bit but really excellent! good price too!
Not much to say, it does the trick though.
Excellent ramen, we grab the first dish on the conveyor belt (we don't speak a word of Japanese) and it was perfect, pleasant and friendly
I don't speak Spanish, but the chipolatas were very moist!
A piece of Italy right in the 15th arrondissement.
Very classy service, exquisite quality dishes.
An added plus: the small deli at the entrance.
On a date, with family or for business, don't hesitate trying it.
On the 6th of January, Jardins Pamplemousse celebrates the epiphany by offering you the chance to win 1 of 3 trips to Barcelona... Buy a large hot drink and you'll get a free slice of apple galette which might contain the winning token
If you want to eat, go somewhere else
If you want a quick bite, you can get a falafel or a shawarma; or you can just relax on the terrace.
Super fresh products and good hospitality
Mmmmm iced tea
Fave: lentil soup
The Hawaiian chicken noodles and the tomyamkung soup!!!!
My god!!!! Its delicious.
Yum yum! Though best to avoid the sushi, the origami is the best!!!
I have a preference for their cupcakes and paninis.
There's ubuntu cola (and free Wi-Fi somewhere around).
17.50 buffet evenings and weekends
A pleasant place, when it's not full.
Fast service, good food and above all shisha heyla!

Indulge yourself: come and eat all kinds of sushi, maki, wok and grilled food as well as a very varied buffet.
Fellow food lovers, this is paradise!
One of my favorite places.
If you've never tried bubble tea or zen zoo, go there without further delay.
11.50 for pasta carbonara with a mandatory extra fee for cheese.
A little too expensive for pasta...
Souffl√© and mocha
Avoid garish colors‚Ä¶
Deluxe McRoyal
You have to go there if only for the new (Spanish) waiter!
Very kind and very friendly guy, who apart from doing his job is very philosophical!
Other than that the food is great as usual!
the Wi-Fi connection is free, the waiters are smiley and the service is fairly decent, one of the best rated caf√©s in La Soukra
A pleasant breakfast! Great service too.

‚Ç¨6.50 a pint during happy hour, it's really worth it #theyarereallytakingthepiss
Cheap pint during happy hour.
Cool place for an after-work coffee.
The d√©cor is maybe a bit tacky, also a bit stuffy.
A fast food restaurant with a difference in Limoges.

The veal carpaccio and the mozzarella burrata, it's heaven for the taste buds:) a real treat!
Mostly for the terrace in the summer - the cocktails aren't bad and the happy hour is good value for money. Also for Oliver, the resident cat. Don't take any chance eating there though.
Very good Italian restaurant (not pizzeria).
Nice owner, a nice terrace for sunny days and good value for money.
The bresaola and the "appettito" pasta are excellent!
Very good burger, cool trendy clientele, one of the best places in the neighborhood
specializes in sea food and famma fannoud :)
I tried it but didn't like it much, I prefer cosmitto or even smug's
Great for a pre-meal drink!
Those who are always peckish will be thrilled by the brownies, muffins, savory open sandwiches, and dry sausage served with their drinks!
Yum yum yum Pizza...
The tuna pizza is delicious
The monster, monster, and monster, nothing beats it!
Some of the best ramen in Paris, try the salt ramen and the katsudon and make sure you don't miss out on the Gyosa
Avoid the brunch at all cost: cold chocolate, 1 ridiculously small croissant, horrible scrambled eggs, sticky pancakes and tasteless cheesecake...
Yuk, I strongly advise you to avoid it.
The Super sunny burger is delicious
Best sushi in town, say hi to the chef/owner <NAME> and try the sushi pizza and/or the chef's salad!
Hearty Portions, fast service, smiley staff.
Lots of fillings inside the pancakes.
The egg, potato & bacon breakfast platter lacks seasoning, a bit bland.
Pretty good actually.
Great service, very welcoming, very tasty food, pretty d√©cor, all for a good price.
the churros and the thick hot chocolate... opposite the town market. yummy
Location says "Dumegeute"... lol
The pata negra is always delicious (as is the bufala); watch out the portions are very big!
The carpaccio is great, however it's not possible to reserve, if your friends are late, the restaurant keeps trying to seat other people at your table.
The service is really not great.
With its playful d√©cor, a very pleasant place for a drink, or to polish off their double bacon cheeseburger!
Not too many people in the middle of the week, free tables on the shopping mall terrace: the best place to enjoy a good burger
Very nice since the change of management. Best tartes flamb√©es in the city center. The kidneys are also awesome.
Br√ªlerie Ste-Foy (across from Ste-Foy market) just 6 min away is really the best. No, there are two Starbucks, one at the Pyramide and the other on Germain des pr√©s, next to Laurier Quebec
Try the vanilla ice cream very good

With an inventive "family style" cuisine and rich in flavour.
For all patients!...
Fishing, peaceful and green...
Absolutely love the Brooklyn bagel (as good as in NY) and the cookies for dessert!
The setting is super nice, the staff are welcoming, the prices very reasonable.
Go for it !
Excellent sandwiches and salads with great staff.
What could you want better..?
Don't hesitate to change restaurant!
Deterioration of the quality of food and service‚Ä¶ it's a real pity : /
I certainly do not recommend the mikado crepes.
The crepe was cooked several times, we would have thought to be eating a piece of cardboard.
On the other hand the cheese tartine is excellent
Lots of good pastries!
The bread is certainly from the day before, it is hard.
The same managers for 37 years and always so attentive.
Content to have found this simple and authentic place, quite rare in the neighborhood.
Just excellent from all points of view!
Very good welcome at 8.30, I'll be back.
The mixed menu and the salmon on skewer
Really good, fast and cheap!
Good burger and pleasant setting.
On the other hand, the extra salad is not worth $4.
Very nice restaurant where the waiters attend to your every need, the dishes are of quality and allow you to spend a good time on the terrace in summer and in traditional decor in winter

Magnificent view of Clermont-Ferrand

Jupiler;)

During the period from June 15 to August 30, the activity programme is dedicated to satisfying all requirements, with particular attention to fun, recreational and sports events.

The beef is excellent!!
It's not the best pizzeria in the area!
The best room in Paris
The best bakery in the area and one of the best in Li√®ge!!
The cafe is well located, not expensive.
On the other hand, in winter and in the interior it is freezing and you come out with the smell of the dish of the day.
Opt rather for the terrace as soon as it's warm :)
A must see in Li√®ge, for me the best in the city centre
If you want a good Italian coffee!!!!

Connivance with your neighbours guaranteed.
Impeccable service, attentive without being too formal.
And delicious dishes with a special mention for the lobster carpaccio!
The restaurant does not look like much but the dishes are tasty.

Magic moments to share with your baby: -)
A magical place, where you can have a tea on a day of clear sky.

There's nothing here despite a promising decoration.
The octopus, the rainbow trout, the duck breast, the cauliflower...
All delicious, but the find is the black pudding, served with mussels and chanterelles...
Even those who don't like black pudding loved it!
Always keep your head high, though.
Best location on the riverside road.
Opposite the Mus√©e d'Orsay, it is ideal for an aperitif and even a little later.

Avoid except for the foolproof poutine or nachos.

Too bad about the city centre
A pleasant and refined place, where you can enjoy fresh fish while having a view of the Atlantic.
Special mention to the Pageot.

A real French cusine with quality wine!
Lack of meat why not but the lack of taste and decor in the middle of hardcore vegans it's too much!
Low price with a wide choice of programming
The tiramisu is disgusting
The cr√™pes are good and the open sandwiches too (served with a good salad) The caramel cr√™pe with salted butter is a killer!

Although regulars and lovers of this place, what a surprise to have been treated so unpleasantly this affternoon!
Not sure we'll set foot in there again, too bad.
Always room and always Wi-Fi!

very good burgers, original products and of quality, I loved the bartholom√©! I recommend to take the take away (or outright delivered) because the restaurant is rather narrow and quickly packed!
Sit in the shade of the pine trees and enjoy
Renovated cinema is not a sign of better quality!

Quality Belgian cuisine all whilst being affordable.
Delicious sole meuni√®re, excellent moules-frites...
The decor of a typical Brussels brasserie, like the accent of the friendly young owner. ;-)
The cashew chicken is a gem!

A really good restaurant that combines refined cuisine and impeccable service.
The cooking of the meat and fish is perfect.

Caf√© more or less okay with fast service
Typical south indian dishes.
Special recommendation for Les Dosays

Pass the guilt when thinking about their chickens raised in battery-farms worthy of a middle age torture room, it's frankly good and the service efficient and smiling
- 10% when you take as takeaway.
The buzz of Geneva.
We love the pizzas "centro tavola" to share, including the succulent "Luigia" with buffalo, scamoza, mushrooms and truffles, just like the classics like bolognese or ossobucco.
Great environment of the park I love to go there to eat during lunchtime because a lot of benches and the climate allows you to get away from the city for a break

Museum, the history, restaurant, the wind, the smell of the sea... i love
Nice setting but, there are days with and days without...
Unpleasant service and it's expensive!
There's much better elsewhere.
Both the mojito and the cooking...
I tend to say the opposite of Pierre: the food is good, the vegetables crunchy and tasty.
On the other hand, it's a bit of a canteen atmosphere, (lunchtime only?) which is quite surprising.
Careful, there's plenty of nudes...
But it's dog friendly!
A nice place but the service is toooo long...
You have to have nerves of steel to stand the wait.
Just the right place...
Gargantuan portions.
Wines: ask the waiter for the wines of the moment (ironically the menu)

The t√™te de lion curry is top.

And they have one card machine for 3 tills!!!

Very nice, too bad for the holes in the arbour :( #it's raining)
I have tasted several quiches in Paris but the best I have eaten is that of aux desirs de Manon.
Especially the ham-and-goat cheese quiche.
Just perfect!
Right now, all coffee sizes at $1
Pizzas are not bad but the service was more than average...
I'm far from being a fine-dough lover, but the pizza in this restaurant is worth a visit (‚àí take away preferably)
Stade de rocourt, this is the family home of the reds and blues.
The paradise of the 3rd Age and rare remnants of pretty houses
I recommend the menu of the day, although all the dishes on the menu look delicious!
The music is too loud to hear each other speak, the auvergnate quiche has no taste, the dough is rubbery: I am disappointed, shame because the place is very beautiful!
Too much to drink = poutineville!
It's already the place to be.
The smile of the owner, the energy she gives off, her sister in the kitchen to launch the machine, happiness every time!

A chip shop with a bancontact, the best!

If this is the best burger in Paris then there is room to launch a new one!!
We're nowhere near Taylor's in California or Shake Shake in NYC..
It's not real pastrami, either.
Service much too slow

Now a mandatory visit on my next trip to MPL.

Poutine to avoid unfortunately...
Good restaurant: I recommend caramelized barbecue ribs.
Despite their kindness, the servers are incompetent: I have never been served without a mistake on my order.
(Avoid <NAME>)
The ribs are melt-in-the-mouth, the sauce to die for.
Maybe one of the best restaurants I've known (even the bread is great!)
Ask for your receipt, the servers are not honest!
Try the poutine "pat√© chinois"

Quickly full though, great with friends.
the caramel salted butter flavour... delicious
Still be careful with your order at the drive-thru, not always in order...
The basement is only open during the day, but it's distinctly more comfortable than the main floor.

It's not worth moving for that.

Advice to visitors regarding restaurants: avoid the place Saint-Louis (except Caf√© du commerce), and go for the Boem (original, hearty, delicious) or to Dit Vin, but not Atelier de Nicolas, overrated.

But otherwise it's very very very good!
Electric atmosphere, great music... you can also come and eat before dancing for a complete and perfect evening.
