BBQ double burger!!!!
At the local bar, you can have a delicious bite to eat opposite the Bassin de la Villette.
On nice days, deckchairs are available
Coffee signature cocktail
I don't recommend the buttermilk!!!
I recommend the waffles üòç
Cozy little teahouse, amazing sweets and teas.
They also serve lunch.
Nice and plenty of room.
A nice atmosphere to hang out with friends.
Full of good things to try.
Perfect for tea time.
The sales assistants are super friendly.
If you've never tasted it, try the Calpis (a milk-based Japanese drink) ;)!!
Always packed but always friendly.
Delicious Welsh rarebit with Maroilles cheese and Flemish stew, great service! üòã
Very good coffee, fair price for the district.

The authentic food truck serving a "true" burger.
And the truck boss comes from the same country as the two things previously mentioned: the USA!
The cakes are delicious, but the waiters are not very nice
A fantastic terrace for drinks when the weather is good.
Nice interior decoration in the restaurant.
Simple menu but good food.
Excellent French cuisine, a limited menu but quality guaranteed. The pollock with shellfish is fantastic.
Main courses around 18 to 23 euros.
Service a little bit overwhelmed.
Top-quality Korean restaurant with traditional dishes and terrace area.
Very popular terrace in summer, also very noisy but very good ambiance!
Great burgers and really cool vibe :)
The famous home-made hot chocolate remains exceptional. Perfect in the afternoon with a cake (the Mont-Blanc is to die for).
Quick service, low price, but the quality of some dishes is not so great.
Very busy at lunchtime.
A really lovely place to eat shortcake „Ç∑„Éß„Éº„Éà„Ç±„Éº„Ç≠ I recommend traditional strawberry shortcake, 3 citrus fruit jelly, tuna-mayo onigiri ... The bread's also really good.

Very nice place for an after party
The matcha pastries are scrumptious!
Nothing special about the burgers!
For a restaurant in the La D√©fense neighborhood, it's actually really good‚Ä¶!!!
The idea to cook up pasta right in front of the client is still a hit.
One of the best quick-serve pasta restaurants.
The greatest problem you'll run into is finding an empty seat :)
A 1 hour wait and no fries left‚Ä¶
It's the must-see place, but I don't recommend it for eating. It's quite noisy, and yes, the waiters rush around, but are they really efficient??? Because you wait for a long time
An absolute gem... on weekends with friends or your other half ^_^
Quick, not too expensive, and American drinks!
Especially the Mountain Dew Voltage
Perfect place for a light meal in a pleasant setting.
I've had better service and I wouldn't recommend their cookie.
The terrace and happy hour!
The salads with Maroilles cheese sauce are nice
Don't eat there!
But ok for a drink.
Good ambiance but expensive.
Some original dishes
If you like coffee, you must go here. Coffees from all over the world and a nice welcome, enjoy!
Very good, particularly the smooth soy ragout and the bowl of rice with egg!
The rum baba is better at Bl√© Sucr√© in the Square Trousseau.
The bread and lemon tarts here are excellent.
Get there 1/2 an hour before it opens ;) to avoid having to wait too long as the queue gets bigger very quickly. And now I understand why the Classic Burger + fries is said to be the best üëçüòÉ
Salmon skewers and a nice bottle of white wine = best dinner ever.
Ask <NAME> for the champagne pipe.
Excellent spot for a peaceful breakfast in Paris!
The rolled oat/chocolate cookie is superb and the coffee master is really great!
Classic tea shop, hot chocolate to die for!
A nice chic bar.
The drinks are affordable... but it‚Äôs self-service.
Small, friendly restaurant with a warm welcome and crazy d√©cor. Not expensive.
You can hear Spanish and French spoken all over.
The dishes are decent and homemade.
Vegetarian and gluten-free options üòä
Lousy service, not even a smile‚Ä¶fascist
Much more than I expected
The macaroons are famous, but the pastries and ice creams...
Yum too
It's re-opened and oh so pretty!!
Chai Tea Latte, here I come ;)
It's good but it's so noisy!
Really good restaurant, with great Laotian sausages and tasty coconut milk chicken.
A good charcuterie platter and excellent meat.
Great dim sum.
Efficient service with a smile!
A rare find!
Really good dishes to eat-in or take-out.
The typical Breton atmosphere and the double-stacked crepes :)
The burgers are so good, it‚Äôs really worth the 2 or ‚Ç¨3 extra compared to MacDonald's or Quick, it was like being at In and Out Burger in the US, we‚Äôll be back
The donuts are very good, especially the strawberry one.
On the other hand, the cronut was not cooked enough for me.
But overall, good donuts for a reasonable price.
Grossly unfair prices!
1 litre of coke costs 14 euros, pleasant staff and location
Hard to find anywhere to sit if there are more than 2 of you, but still a nice place.
It would be difficult to be more unfriendly...
Quality cuisine, the wait times can be long during peak hours‚Ä¶
Meal gets cold before everyone at your table is served!
Horrible reception, you're better off across the street where they're much nicer!
Very nice atmosphere and very generous meals!
Very very good Ramen.
Credit card payments from 16‚Ç¨.
The worst Italian food I've tasted in Paris.
And don't mention the service.
Very ordinary and rather expensive bar-restaurant.
The platters are generous.
Thumbs down for the waiter who rushed us when ordering.
Great terrace if you can find a spot.
‚Ç¨8 Bo Bun, what more could you ask for?
The best value for money for a Thai restaurant in Paris.
A 1 hour wait but it's worth it!!!!
Cozy / hipster atmosphere
Good quantities.
9-15 euros
Skip the starters, the main course is enough on its own.
A very good cucumber cocktail and a very good tequila.
This is one of my favorite bars for cocktails and especially for the very attentive barmen!
You can park your car at the Massena center just opposite
It's good, the waiters are nice but incredibly unskilled!
A view of the skyscrapers of La Dafense at sunrise with a latte to get the day started.
My HQ to have a GOOD coffee in a pleasant place from time to time.
The machines are cleaned several times a day so as not to leave any residue at the bottom of the mugs.
A good burger at a fast-food price
Simple but inexpensive burgers.
It‚Äôs nice speaking English with the waiters.
Chirashi: delicious!
The bentos (‚Ç¨14 at noon/‚Ç¨16 in the evening) are very good too!
A freshly squeezed juice is a must!
The green tea cake isn't a hit, very good carrot cake though
A really nice place, great staff, good food (the NY rib sauce is a killer).
My only complaint would be that it‚Äôs really noisy so much so that our waiter couldn‚Äôt hear the order.
A very good Indian where the naans are particularly delicious.
The takeaway dishes are affordable and they often give you a free dessert.
But it's very hot on the upper floor, both in winter and summer.
It may be a cocktail bar, but you'd best stick with the wine ^^!!
Otherwise, I suggest you order the Chinese crepes Yum ;)
Cheap beer, generally good atmosphere
Amazing view from this restaurant!
The place is nice and empty on Sundays at 12:30 p.m.‚Ä¶
I probably shouldn't give it away though ;)
Ideal for breakfast in the sun
The dishes are excellent, the layout is fantastic and the service is friendly
These macaroons might be heaven itself, but the pastries are even better!
The raspberry rose Saint Honor√© is delicious.
As for the tea, a special mention for <NAME>, absolutely delightful.

Deals were not very clear and touchy waiter who treats you like an idiot (!!)
Very nice bar where the drinks and platters are not expensive!
Save the date February 10 for Dailymotion
A little snack on the terrace
Often seen as one of the best burgers in Paris, I was very *disappointed*, as much by the sandwich as by the atmosphere.
That aside, the *service is fast* and not unpleasant
The merveilleux at Merveilleux is marvelous...
Not very original food, acceptable service, but the place itself is beautiful!
Good terrace, reasonable prices and you can dance the night away
That garden though‚Ä¶
Delicious lemon tart!
Our friends at BIA don't allow ladies who are 8 months pregnant!
Appetizers and cigarettes in the secret garden, followed by an authentic dinner, excellent and affordable inside.
Genuinely pure bliss‚Ä¶
The goat's cheese cheesecake isn't bad, try it!
Ask for mayonnaise at the start of the meal.
A 1 hour 30 wait in line for a burger that was nothing special and ultra greasy fries ... very disappointing ...
As far as pastries go, nothing beats Flower's!
The pasta and pizza are delicious, sadly spoiled by poor treatment and service
Order an aperitif at lunchtime and you don't even get a few bites to snack on...
This place is known for its famous giant lemon meringue pies!
Ideal to spend time with a friend with a nice cup of tea and a cake!
The service is always really friendly, decent dishes.
Delicious Flat White üëå.
The lamb shank is delicious!
Best tea room in Paris.
Very good bento and dessert
Original and delicious desserts

It's awesome, very good.
Great welcome and good service.
Beware, very busy and risk having to wait to get in as there isn't enough space.
Burger of the month!
Try out a different flavor every month.
watch out, they don't accept card payment!
Roast Pork Ramen, a delight!
At least for the lemon meringue pie;-)
Guy Martin takes us on a discovery of the world of coffee in the Epicerie Fine tv show!
Pollock fillet
Fantastic waffles!!
Everybody talks about Ladur√©e in Paris but Meert in Lille holds its own.
Completely crap
Wow, it's awesome.
The same #Miznon as in Tel Aviv, just as friendly, just as good.
Probably the best #kebab ever. #foudfood #streetfood
Very good French dishes, nice setting
All the same, the BB burger is pretty good.
Good unpretentious bar with cheap beer.
The terrace closes at 8, shame
Chic but unpretentious.
We enjoyed the open view of the kitchen and the high ceilings.
The food is good but could do with more effort presentation-wise.
Definitely make the most of the terrace.
A delight is what this bar is, where we eat at midday and drink in the evening, always in a pleasant atmosphere that lifts your mood.
The pastries are a real treat!
There's not much room upstairs.
Great location.
Come here to avoid the rush at the Opera Starbucks.
An open air event at La Rotonde it‚Äôs Sunday and it‚Äôs FREE!
Come and enjoy the young artists (concerts, exhibits, live performance and an electro-swing DJ set) from 16:00 until 22:00!
Perfect for after work!
Waiters and waitresses excellent :)
Good blind test, serious pros in the house!
Very good atmosphere, inexpensive food.
The duck confit is not bad.
Very cool tearoom.
Very busy in winter but the tarts are to die for and the "Le Loire dans la th√©i√®re" is a must.
Delicious little vegetarian meals (among others) but the service is a bit unpleasant and the restrooms are to be avoided at all costs!
Great discovery :) Good burgers :)
<NAME>: the best milkshake I've had to this day (Oreo flavoured). You should also try their JD burger flamed with whiskey!
Too busy.
Average quality, I've seen better. It's all show, the taste is average.
Bravo to the marketing department‚Ä¶
Poor quantity, 5 raviolis or so for 12.70 Euros.
In August, get there after 1.30pm as there's less people and the inner terrace area is fantastic!!!! üç∑‚òÄ
Iberian platter and cheese plate, a winning combination.
The products are truly high-quality!
Bobun very expensive (26‚Ç¨), restaurant often full and noisy.
Otherwise, quite nice.
Slow service, waited 40 minutes to place my order.
It's getting worse and worse :-(
Good service, but food quality very average given the price.
Tried once, but wouldn't go back again.
Make yourself comfortable on the huge red sofa when the weather's good and enjoy a cocktail before heading out to one of the many theaters nearby!
A bit disappointed - the place is too noisy on the weekend, the service could be improved and they really rush you to leave.
But the Loire tea and the tarts are delicious!
A friendly place and welcoming.
The tartare wasn‚Äôt bad, no more than that but the presentation of the food was really thoughtful.
South American restaurant, with a focus on Venezuelan/Colombian and Mexican.
Everything is excellent, try it all and don't forget the fresh fruit juice! #Enjoy
I've never eaten such good broccoli!
Just grilled broccoli #Yum
Order a seafood platter!
The Sicilian tartare is a treat!
Very nice Parisian setting, popular and not pretentious
The pork kimchi is excellent as is the japche!!!
Meetings, relaxing sessions, get-togethers, dates, studying‚Ä¶
It's always better in a Starbucks!!! :)
Best terrace in Paris. Filled with sunlight from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. and it's very relaxing!
The entrecote steak was as good as ever!
Rue Nollet or rue Lemercier, it‚Äôs worth it!
Excellent coffee, even if the ristretto is too acidic; divine carrot cake.
Boho atmosphere and a bit awkward.
Offhand service, not very clever.
Disappointed with the place, not the dishes.
Ask to sit at the bar so you can watch the head sushi chef at work.
Exceptional fish preparation, worthy of any Japanese restaurant
The little garden is cool.
Nice bar but waiters are borderline rude.
There are a ton of bars in the area, avoid this one‚Ä¶
You must absolutely show up when it opens at 7 p.m. if you want to land a table in the garden.
Affordable menu prices.
3 types of menu, normal fries, with cheese... The burgers are nice and not too heavy.
The cheese fries are greasy... don‚Äôt eat too many
The cat burger!!!
Yum yum and all the rest ;)
The pot-au-feu with organic vegetables is an excellent choice!
The food is really good, the service is flawless and all for a reasonable price.
Don‚Äôt be put off by the decor or how it looks from the outside.
Delicious oysters, attractive wine menu, cocktails up to par with the candelaria and glass group standard!
It‚Äôs a great place, what else to say.
However, it‚Äôs better for a drink than a meal (food is nothing special).
The terrace is huge and really friendly!
Shame, the food is so bad!
BTW, price very reasonable for the Champs.
best raspberry tart in Paris!
A warm welcome, polite and attentive staff, high-quality ingredients and food
Fantastic Korean barbecue. The Bibimbap is also excellent!
Delicious! Especially the ROSE macaroon, but the queue.... is just unbearable.....
A well-deserved break on the terrace in 24-degree weather‚Ä¶
Pathetic service and the dining area is often disgusting, but for those who miss New York, this offers that American vibe.
Not only is there delicious tea and exquisite homemade hot chocolate, but you will find the best lemon meringue pie in all of Paris.
Really nice atmosphere, one of the waiters looks like Manu Paillet!!
The charcuterie platter was great!!!
Dishes from 17 - ‚Ç¨25
The Japchae is good.
I found the beef Bulgogi was lacking in flavour.
Nice setting and good service
Awesome quality burgers for the price!
A bit more effort needed on the fries!
Not very expensive for the location.
A bit rushed in the evening but friendly atmosphere
Expensive food given the quality on offer and very standard (tartar served with 6 French fries, overcooked penne pasta...) but the view is superb.
Go there when the weather is good.
Excellent cuisine and very nice restaurant
A really spicy restaurant!
The sun is always shining in this Colombian restaurant.
Dishes really not expensive (9-13‚Ç¨) but quality very, very average
Burger and fries rather average
Haven't eaten such great melon pan since my last time in Tokyo. Even better, those in Aki are homemade...
The ultimate bobo bar in Belleville.
I recommend Happy Hour, every evening from 6 to 9 p.m.
‚Ç¨3.50 a beer.
Take a beer on the sunny terrace!
It‚Äôs a cool place, but don't go for lunch: the food is not so good.
Good location, but very noisy as it is often packed
Good pizzas, but certainly not the best in Paris.
The tiramisu on the other hand is outstanding
Don't come to this joint in a large group of 14.
You'll be cramped for space.
Generous servings and the escalope montagne is almost like the ones at Gladine Charonne and Batignolles!
Good service but it took a little longer towards the end :)
Pretty random service but finally real Japanese Sushi in Paris!
You'll be lining up for an empty seat.
Perfect on the terrace in the summer!
The best pizza I've had in France.
Plenty of choice, maybe too much of it :-)
A specialty caf√© amongst the most refined in Paris.
Sit down on the bench for a while to appreciate their expressos from Has Bean or elsewhere.
The Bubble Teas are very good and imaginative!
Fruit marbles from molecular cooking!
The lemon tart is terrific‚Ä¶
Don't sit close to the door in winter!
The platters were amazing!
The oysters are really delicious!
The Mont Blanc has been served since 1903, sticking to the same recipe.
I approve the Derby Daiquiri (for its orange juice based fruity freshness) and the Engenho de Picante (for its sublime spicy touch from the Thai chilies)
Very good and not expensive, great atmosphere, excellent rock music.
My HQ for 8 years‚Ä¶ waitresses that are always delightful, a pure Mexico/D.F. atmosphere and traditional and delicious Latin-American dishes not restricted to Mexico.
don‚Äôt miss the opportunity
The most hipster bar in Paris.
Really impressive.
I didn't think the concept could be pushed so far.
Very disappointed for the first time‚Ä¶ we must have bothered them‚Ä¶
Dinner is expensive but the terrace is great, there's always space and sunlight.
The best "pour over" (filter) coffee in the city.
Pizzas are good, but it's chaotic
Take this opportunity to enjoy a lobster menu‚Ä¶
Coffee? Sure.
Brunch? I'll pass.
Better fall back on the Franprix next door and its promotion on Pepitos cookies.
Been going to this restaurant for years, nothing to say‚Ä¶
Service is always top‚Ä¶
Except today, we froze out butts off on the terrace, but very delicious!!
Must do it again as soon as poss!!
Nice staff and setting but a Parisian bistro can do better: soft homemade fries and soggy dessert.
3-May
*** : Really busy so a bit noisy, the choice of burgers is impressive, the Pastrami is delicious.
Think about arriving early: no reservations, so the line grows quickly!
The wait was a bit long but man do you eat well!
Service is sometimes a bit slow, but it‚Äôs a nice location
They eat better in Sweden‚Ä¶
‚Ç¨10.50 for most pittas.
Small quantity, but rather good.
On the other hand, the service is slow and not that pleasant...
Delicious even if it's sometimes too busy at midday.
Less busy around 2 p.m.
Try the cakes while you wait
It's peculiar‚Ä¶
Cocktails and bar atmosphere
Try out the Marcel burger and the burger of the day.
Saturday/Sunday brunch is awesome and you get service with a smile
Excellent Guatemalan coffee
Good atmosphere and non-stop service. Overall, not expensive.
A sandwich fills you up and their naan bread is really delicious
Delicious bagels, with a little American food store.
The place is a bit eccentric but very pleasant, very nice decor.
The menu features hundreds of different dishes, ideal if you want to have spare ribs, flammenkuchen, crepes, and fondue all at the same table.
Far from the best bagels I've ever eaten, but the place is nice
Have a morning coffee at the counter and get your day off to the right start :D
the bagels are good, good value for money and they are also open non-stop until 10 p.m., which is great! The other little bonus is the American food store in the restaurant!
A nice place and the Chilean wine is great ^^
Coffee, St-Honor√© cake and buy some macaroons as a gift.
Avoid the brunch it's a bit of a let-down.
The place is overrated.
a station concourse and that's no understatement! If you at least got good, hot food.... but no
Typical northern dishes, not expensive, a lovely patio, warm welcoming and faultless service.
Don't hesitate, you won't be disappointed.
Chocolate √©clair, delicious.
The pizzas are very good and the terrace is truly lovely.
This Korean restaurant is great value for money
You don't want to be hungry when you order a waffle :)
The best creperie‚Äì don't forget the cider!
Excellent restaurant, great setting and service. Come with friends, with your partner or your family. Beautiful place!
I thought it wasn't bad, good food and the right quantity with reasonable prices. +1
I don't know if it's typical of this place but the servers were incredibly sweet.
Very good value for money for this restaurant, a stone's throw from the Champs Elys√©es!
Try their Mojito and their parmesan tartare. You won't be disappointed!
Only problem with this place: the music is too loud!
The barbecued duck!
Nice bar but it needs to improve its level of friendliness!
No signs on the completely grey exterior, but there is indeed a bar / restaurant.
A great place, cozy and very nice for a date with a choice of very good cocktails.
A perfect bar for a drink especially on the terrace when the weather's good and to have a quick bite before the theater or a movie!
You can‚Äôt get the ultimate burger anymore :'( but if you ask for the ultimate fries you still get a 1 euro discount on cheese fries!
The best: the Mont Blanc, enormous (stodgy according to some critics), with the right amount of whipped cream and a thick layer of chestnut.
Curry and other dishes just like over there.
The cheeseboard is great
Fabulous rillettes
It's round, It's chocolatey, and it's delicious. And that lemon tart, that raspberry tart, mmm! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•
A real tourist trap!
The quality of service leaves something to be desired considering the prices charged.
Forget Hokkaido and Higuma, the ramen + gyoza here are better.
What could be better than a mocha under the Lille sunshine
The king of bentos!
I also recommend their freshly squeezed fruit juices!
no meal tickets, no credit card‚Ä¶so I left! It's shameful...And you can see the pile of pre-made galettes sitting behind the counter!!!!
Inexpensive considering the neighborhood, pleasant terraced area
Authentic and generous cuisine, freshly cooked naans, organic flour, great!
Small quantity but good quality at a decent price üëç
Ask to be seated in the garden, very calm
Disgusting, stay far away because while everyone is harping on about the service, the food is far worse.
No freshly squeezed orange juice, just Tropicana.
A crap welcome: that says it all.
I don‚Äôt fancy spending ‚Ç¨100 at Train Bleu...
We brush shoulders with great Puerto Rican actors...
Good+simple+not expensive+nice owner = packed for lunch
Always just as packed, but very nice.
The barmen are really friendly as are (almost) all of the barmaids...
You eat well here (very decent and not expensive at all). The customers are friendly and the beer is good
‚Ç¨2.90 a pint during Happy Hour.
You need to get there early if you want to have a good time as it gets packed out quickly‚Ä¶
Very good Welsh rarebit with Maroilles cheese!
‚Ç¨3.50 for the hot chocolate and ‚Ç¨4 for a pastry.
Good, and the atmosphere is cool.
Immense terrace bathed in sunlight when the sky is clear and great desserts to share
A bit noisy but the cakes are delicious.
Ideal for afternoon tea in winter.
Good table, fantastic setting with the peaceful terrace overlooking the square.
BUT, dishes and service not precise and thorough enough given the price. The waitress was half-naked wtf?
To be avoided at the weekend, small so always packed.
Perfect welcome, and homemade hot chocolate for ‚Ç¨3.
Don't go at the busy times in winter, the wait is very long because the place is really great
Grab a table as soon as you've been handed a menu, then head to the cooking area.
Otherwise you'll be stuck waiting for your food and have trouble finding a seat later
Always just as generous and the quality of products hasn't lowered despite the reputation of the place.
Little place, often very crowded but that's a good sign in this establishment.
The menus aren't very interesting if you don't like Udon.
The Kimchi is mass-produced.
The Katsu Curry is delicious.
Only problem, no jugs of water.
At the counter, ask for the secret triple triple menu: cheese fries, ultimate style fries, protein style burger, ultimate style burger, veggie burger etc.
Price, welcome and food all excellent here.
The place that confirmed that I prefer savory to sweet.
Overdose for me.
If you go as a group, send someone off to save a table for the rest‚Ä¶
Thin, cripsy pizzas, and fairly rapid service. I recommend it
Fatty, junk food and expensive for what it is, a ‚Äúgreasy spoon cafe‚Äù really living up to its name.
The orange juice isn‚Äôt bottomless even though on the menu
The Kahlua "caf√© gourmand" is amazing!
One of the best places to eat burgers in Paris!
Not possible to reserve, so come early!
The Crispy Ta√Æ Ta√Æ, Salmon Tartare and the Emperors' Himalaya for dessert.
Nice little miso soup and a wicked Beef Don!
Bohemian or not‚Ä¶
It depends what time of the day it is‚Ä¶
So, anything else?
Very generous brunch and friendly service‚Ä¶
Ideal way to gently wake up on a Sunday morning!
Excellent brunch featuring fresh and delicious products, friendly staff
Not the seats at the back
Not the terrace
Delicious but a bit expensive in the evening (totally different to midday)
1 meal, 2 cockroaches‚Ä¶
Kinda spoilt the experience :-(
Nice, small, original cafe where you can buy the coffee you drink!
*** : Excellent terrace for the area, the interior decoration is also very impressive for this historic building and the prices are reasonable.
A keeper!
Really busy at the weekend.
‚Ç¨4.90 for a gourmet coffee: 3 small snowball cakes and an espresso.
‚Ç¨10 menu (burger + fries) - ‚Ç¨8 burger only - ‚Ç¨3 the house fries - ‚Ç¨3 coleslaw salad - ‚Ç¨4 cheesecake
Small store that fills up very quickly, staff is has their hands full but still friendly.
The pastries are good and the equinox cake is THE bee's knees!
The service must have been altered in 2013!
Great reception and wait staff is friendly and helpful.
The first French Starbucks that opened in 2004.
You serioulsy think it's hip and happening 6 years later?
Great value for this quartier. Come early for a place on the terrace or veranda.
Once we'd understood the concept, it was rather nice, even if very noisy...
Start with a bottle of Chilean, then have a bottle of Chilean, and finish with a bottle of Chilean
Very good cheesecake!
Make sure you try the pastrami :)
A good option to avoid the Rue Sainte Anne surcharge!
Funky, designer, delicious.
The coffee with cream is incredibly large and delicious as is the curry chicken stew with veggies
It's not that great and way too expensive.
The look of the place is the only thing worth a visit.
Mediocre wine, mediocre meal, mediocre desserts.
The best lemon tart in the world
But what a crap bar. I've never seen anything like it.
Unpleasant service (even though I remained polite, not like the guy in charge at the bar), disgusting beer. It's gone straight onto the blacklist.
The sweet and savory crepes are both delicious, the artisanal cider is very good.
Too bad they don't accept card payment.
I will return
Perfect reception and service, fresh and affordable products, excellent pizza with a take-away option
Disappointed, it's noisy
Slow but decent, I don't agree with the criticisms regarding the service
Very inconsistent service.
Disappointing burgers: though the menu recipes seem tantalizing, what you get is industrial buns and low-grade meat.
Lovely relaxed setting, idyllic in summer.
Good atmosphere, but service is a bit slow
Friendly service. Reasonable burger. The only real plus is the terrace in the station.
Huge disappointment: not pleased in the least with the contents of my plate, disgusting restrooms, and a miscalculated bill‚Ä¶
I really don't recommend this place‚Ä¶
The cocktails aren't bad.
Food good and fusion style, credit for the sushi. Trendy and original.
A sort of mix between Japanese canteen and Blade Runner d√©cor.
Very nice, great location next to the Saint Martin Canal and not too far from R√©publique, but packed a bit too often (the victim of its own success?)
Very trendy, reflected in the prices‚Ä¶ but the d√©cor and the food make it worth it.
Great bagels!
Renovated setting :)
Anybody know the opening hours? Nothing on the web.
a solid lunch spot, the restaurant belongs to my buddy <NAME>.
The interior is neat and cosy but seats are at a premium when the temperature starts to drop!
You feel guilty about lingering in this situation.
Cake just like home at a good price.
The Inaris are royal.
But you have to get up early.
Charming atmosphere and very good viennoiseries!
But you better be patient if you're heading in for brunch, and you should arrive together if you're in a group lol
Here's our video review: <URL>.
Great evening amongst friends.
Hope this helps you choose!
The soft-boiled eggs with toast soldiers and the goat cheese salad!
Fantastic for a week-end brunch!
The best sweets!! :)
The Funghi + chicken is a must-try.
It's not on the menu but go ahead and ask the chef to whip it up!
Great service and awesome burgers!
Obviously the "African" hot chocolate‚Ä¶ Be warned, often have to wait in line, but if it's nice, you can always do take-away and eat in the Tuillerie Gardens, just opposite ;)
The cocktails are really good and strong (for cocktail lovers).
Beware, a bit expensive.
Nice terrace, but very noisy.
Disappointed with the duck parmentier‚Ä¶ too heavy.
Outside of rush hour, a very nice bar with good mixed platters!
Horrible... service, food, nothing is any good.
Don't fall into this tourist trap.
For a post-dinner drink; a spacious but often shady terrace
Is it for real?
Really weird‚Ä¶
Good good good good good!!!!
I had a roast pork Miso Ramen with additional egg.
The soup was a bit too salty for my liking.
Restaurant worth trying but not to wait in line.
Fast inexpensive dining and great quality with a good atmosphere!
It‚Äôs not bad but to be honest the service was terrible and not friendly at all...
The platters are good and prices really low for the district!
We saw Fran√ßois Hollande on the Japanese news:)
Too freaking good!
Very calm and composed place.
Nothing is expensive and it‚Äôs all homemade!
Ideal to enjoy a generous yet inexpensive dessert (even if a little simple)
By favorite hamburger restaurant
Everything's good so indulge yourself.
The bento just ok
Amazing carrot cake!
Be warned, it's very loud.
Really lovely brasserie with reasonable prices and charming staff!
Genuine Japanese restaurant in Paris.
Very small restaurant so you may end up sharing a table.
Otherwise, simply excellent!
I recommend the fried tartare!
Vanilla Latte for the girls :)
Finally a place to have Tonkotsu Ramen in Paris!
Warmly recommended, lunchtime or evening, whether it's cold (to warm up) or hot (to sweat a bit)!
The best Mont Blanc in the world!!
I have never yet sat down in this tea shop. Generally, I overtake the line of customers to be seated and I go to the cake counter.
I recommend the Vanilla Rooibos Tea Latte with 3/4 soy milk foam and 1/4 water!!!!
Great service and food at a pretty reasonable price.
Quite a chic restaurant in the heart of the 6th district.
Very spacious, the establishment has a laid back and intimate ambiance.
Try the mezzanine for a cocktail.
Terrace has a pretty view of the Arche de la D√©fense, could do with a bit more room.
Slow and inconsistent service.
Ordered several drinks and still no complimentary appetizer platter...
The bagels are really generous and there are also American treats!
Expensive and overrated
Expect a 45 minute wait for your table
Neat concept, good reception, and good food.
Be there at 12 on weekdays to avoid lineups
The best value for money in the quartier!
Little extra for grilled steak with thyme and fries cut with a knife (‚Ç¨12.50) and there's music!
Disappointed by the quality of the cooking
We expected better for the price üòî
Cozy, vintage place, where you'll find a potato omelet, savory tarts, amazing cakes, attentive and sweet middle-aged owners, in a relaxed, boho atmosphere
Excellent service, great food, a real find!
Sophisticated dishes‚Ä¶
Excellent veal chop, creamy cheesecake and best of all the French toast :)
a really slick design with a view over all of Paris
Some people don't hesitate to cross all of Paris to come and taste the famous lemon meringue pie.
The goats cheese burger is fantastic!
One to avoid, it‚Äôs expensive and the service is unfriendly.
Winning threesome: Axoloti + foie gras + chocolate fondants
Stay away: expensive and bad.
If you want a French crepe, voil√†!!!
Best (and almost only) Takoyakis in Paris.
Get the Mabonasu.
Note: specialty and unusual dishes not available before 6.30pm.
The indoor terrace is the best!
Too bad you can't get something to snack on!
The team's nice and the dishes are simple and taste great!
Friendly welcome, quick order
The best of Paris' old Chinatown.
‚Ç¨2.80 a pint at Happy Hour, ‚Ç¨4.00 afterwards.
Nothing more to say.
Don't let the lineup intimidate you!
It advances very steadily.
The staff is efficient and very friendly.
The crepes are delicious and worth the few extra minutes spent waiting to be seated
The best coffee shop in Lille, I recommend the Viennese hot chocolate
This creperie makes nothing but good stuff!
Well-garnished crepes!
Beware, they only take cash!
Without a doubt my favorite tearoom in Paris!
Dish of the day ‚Ç¨9.50 at lunchtimes.
Super value for money particularly for the area.
Charles de Gaulle used to get his waffles here.
The best waffles in the world.
They have gluten-free options!
All the crepes are spectacular‚Ä¶
The 15/ 20 min wait is generally worth it.
The Laotian sausages are a must.
A pad Thai which lives up to the billing.
Sticky mango and coconut rice to die for.
The best restaurant in Belleville, BY FAR!
A fantastic location but really ridiculous prices and pretty average service.
Service is barely acceptable and the pizzas are üëéüèº
Not too bad but not extraordinary either, satisfactory price-quality relationship.
The flammenkuchen isn't very filling.
The food is average and expensive.
The service does not live up to the standard of the restaurant.
It was like being in a canteen.
It's a tourist trap.
The best hot chocolate in Paris in a fabulous d√©cor.
Try the "l'Africain" chocolate.
The cakes haven't been left out.
Note: be ready for a long wait at Tea Time!
These Parisian bentos have captured my heart!
The duck is as tender as can be‚Ä¶
Excellent Chasu Ramen, even much better than some I tasted in japan.
Tonkotsu style soup, more or mess fatty depending on how you like it.
Maybe a bit expensive, but justified by the quantities.
Special of the day: huge marrowbone
A massive lineup for the galette des rois cake‚Ä¶
Perfectly adequate food but the waiter was beyond nasty!!!
All in all, a pretty awful experience.
I suggest you avoid it, there are plenty of nicer restaurants around.
Good food and wine pairing menu, nice service, but not thorough enough: wait a bit long for some orders (mineral water, coffee, bill)
Pizzas until 5am!
Tart, tea and dessert
Good and affordable, something that is more than appreciated in this district. Capirinha / Mojitos and Pesto Tartare are especially recommended.
A really nice place on the canal.
Nice menu and not over the top.
Nice daily specials :)
The pizzas are very very good.
It's pretty busy though, that's the trouble with many restaurants in the area.
Wicked good chicken burger
Meat a bit dry, burgers well garnished and generous portion of fries.
Not as good as Big Fernand which for me remains the burger to beat in Paris at the moment ;)
Terrible to serve drinks or snowball cakes in plastic or polystyrene containers.
That reveals a complete lack of understanding of sustainable development.
Plenty of choice, high-quality toppings.
The crust is baked to perfection!
Very tasty. However, ask for a "less fatty" one so that it isn't as rich‚Ä¶
Gyoza isn't bad either.
Very good, genuine Japanese canteen!
Great burgers for a very reasonable price, just one thing there‚Äôs no takeaway at the weekend
Nice d√©cor, but waiters are inefficient and not very professional.
The service is bad (getting it wrong twice, bravo), and the cocktails are bland.
Terrible, slow service.
Next to (a period bar) happy hour until 10pm...
Breakfast with @<ID>
The √©quinoxe is a hit all year long.
Go for the frangipane cake in January.
Cute little cafe which also sells good cakes
Great food and outstanding service :)
The raspberry tart, the Cara√Øbe, the strawberry cream cake, and the lemon tart‚Ä¶
In order of preference
The Mont Blanc and the hot chocolate are excellent.
Bagels to die for!
As the room is very small, it's best to have a place to sit nearby or avoid the peak times.
I love this place, delicious Bentos made using fresh products.
The juices and desserts are delicious.
Beware, there's generally a long wait involved, this place is a victim of its own success :)
Like in New York, you can order a Budweiser (typical American beer!)
Lovely d√©cor, pretty unpleasant staff.
Looooooong wait.
You can avoid this one, you won't miss anything.
The tarts and cakes are delicious.
Avoid going on Sundays if you don't like waiting
Bistro/caf√© in the 7th arrondissement that makes for a pleasant evening drink.
Big thumbs up for the warm goat cheese salad that always hits the spot!
In a word, wonderful!
Good coffee skills!
First rate breakfast <3
Good cocktails and a relaxed atmosphere.
You can tell it's part of the candaleria group
Delicious pasta but flawed restaurant concept.
At the end of the day, having our food prepared before our eyes translates into more time spent standing in line than actually eating.
Pint now at 7 Euros
They seem to be pretty good...
Lovely terrace and the inside is original too.
It's worth taking a look at this place but the waiters are horrible.
The chicken with Maroilles cheese is not bad :) (not forgetting the beer)
A big brunch and a small price.
American-style atmosphere.
(YOU HAVE TO TRY THE CREAM CHEESE SIDE BAGELS.
If that‚Äôs not happiness, it‚Äôs definitely a close second.)
Attractively presented tartare, fresh, and very tasty
Nothing special here apart from the esthetics of the place.
Taste-wise, there's nothing new here, it's good but not much else.
But the prices are fair ;)
Go for their Omurice, Taka and especially all the Japanese tapas.
If you want to be treated like shit, you're in the right place.
Jam-packed, presentation isn't great, had to send lukewarm meals back to the kitchen. On the other hand, it's a nice place with good service, the waiters are really friendly.
Excellent pizzas, ample choice.
And the dessert pizzas are the best!
No particular decor but a well-priced Happy Hour.
Avoid the downstairs room ;-)
I love the whole vibe and the 70s music, nothing more to say, come check it out!
Good cocktails, sloppy service, bad food.
The andouillette sausage with Maroilles cheese sauce is a wonder :)
Too expensive for those in the know, ‚Ç¨8 a pint and the waiters are quite frankly rude.
Their milkshake is a delight.
An amazing garden.
A victim of their own success. The wait's a little long.
So order a bottle of wine while you're waiting.
Burgers that are half way between the ones at In‚Äôn‚ÄôOut and Five Guys.
Great value for money for fast-food.
Their macaroons are to die for!!
A bit expensive, but they're really worth it :-D
When you get your coffee check out the Priximmo blog at <URL>
Very good bagel, carrot cake to die for and special mention for the food store part!!
The Spritz is excellent!
The wait outside is worth it!
Lovely little outside area.
delicious crumble, the local tea mix is also good...
Service is pleasant but a little indifferent.
The place in itself is nothing special and is a bit noisy.
Good place but not legendary in my opinion
A peaceful haven, and the homemade pastries are awesome
A really long wait if you're in a big group‚Ä¶
Very few fries with the burger but very good anyway‚Ä¶
Great place for Sunday brunch!
Feel free to customize your pasta ;)
The back room might have been my favourite place in Paris but unfortunately, it overlooks a not very clean open kitchen and an extractor hood that leaves a lot to be desired.
Good-looking, non-professional servers.
Nice concept, but the quality isn't there. 11‚Ç¨ for a hot dog and fries without sauce‚Ä¶.
Pretty expensive food for what actually arrives on the plate but excellent wine, very nice staff and unbeatable view.
So we love it!
In the summer, there's free mussels & fries 2 times a week!
A deli modelled on those found across the Atlantic, perfect place to try a pastrami sandwich.
Better get there early in the morning because there's always a crowd between 8:30 a.m. ant 9 a.m‚Ä¶
The menu is a bit hard to understand, but basically: everything in pittas.
Atmosphere is quite variable.
Just one drink‚Ä¶ no more!
The burgers are delicious and the fries excellent.
The place is devoid of charm but there‚Äôs good value for money!
Bo bun and stir-fry Thai beef rice noodles: Unreal!
Really weird house soup.
Nothing special: average service, average menu.
Real Japanese cuisine in Paris. Everything is delicious.
Be warned, a little restaurant where you may need to share your table and wait before being seated.
Excellent bar, really great music and the waiters are friendly!
One of Toulouse's best teahouses!
Fresh and diverse product selection, a very rich, healthy, and enticing menu, a relaxing venue both inside and out in the sunshine!
Not too sure about the decor but the food is the real surprise.
Make sure you book, this place is in demand!
A great neighbourhood spot, good atmosphere all day!
Their burger is delicious (fries of varying quality), the wine is always good and the service is great.
Just for a quick drink and to enjoy the terraces of this historic building.
Excellent coffee in a minimalist but at the same time , warm setting, thanks to the visible beams and the high quality funk soundtrack.
In a word, the anti-Starbucks!
Inexpensive bar but ‚Ç¨2.70 ONLY on the Stella at Happy Hour. Plus there's never "Free couscous on Saturday nights" according to the waitress (big fat lies on all websites!!)
The Mont Blanc is delicious but the service isn't good.
Fun take on the double-stacked galette.
Unfortunately too fatty.
As for the atmosphere, it's a bit factory-like.
The homemade desserts counter is quite simply sublime!
Special mention for the meringue dome on the lemon tart - impressive....
Smack-dab in the middle of the 8th arrondissement this great bar is serving cocktails at ‚Ç¨5.50
I needn't say more.
Very good restaurant with local dishes, great original place to discover northern cuisine, good value.
Busy, so a bit of a wait
Try the afternoon snacks at express bleu, they‚Äôre worth it
The iced coffee is fantastic!
Great servers, nice atmosphere, and decent cocktails for ‚Ç¨9.
Surely the best creperie in Paris, you've got quality, speed, and a warm welcome from the waiters and chefs to top it off!
We wanted to eat like Swedes, but the month of August hit hard!
Featuring Yankee accents and traditional American hamburgers.
To be consumed quickly with a Bud!
(But in moderation).
The JD Burger is simply a dream
The wait and the disorganisation was too much, it's a pity because otherwise the brunch is not bad
Better choice of meat than previously, particularly the 320g sirloin, the 380g rib steak, and a 550g beef prime rib.
Not for sushi but definitely for tempura, gyoza... and even edamame beans!
Perfect for lunch. Good value for money
The dons are very good, try the sesame panna cotta.
The Gyosas are lovely. I tried the Pork Ramen with additional egg.
It was very good, but very fatty!
Sunday night debriefing!
Looking out over Beaubourg, incredible view across the rooftops of Paris.
Nice interior decoration and wonderful terrace for when the sun is shining.
I‚Äôm a big fan of their Milkshake
Awesome burger with fresh ingredients :) (no word of a lie, I could really tell that the onions were fresh!)
Awesome we‚Äôre rediscovering flavours at Siam!
I recommend you try the snake wine, it‚Äôs nameless but great!!
Simply incredible macaroons!!! üòçüòçüòçüòçüòç
Good brunch, generous portions, the right price (25 euros all in), try it out on the terrace and enjoy the sunshine.
However, be ready to wait a little, the service is a bit slow!
Great dish of the day choice
Try the beef bourgignon pitta, delicious!
The Ramen is fat in every sense of the word
You're stuffed when you leave.
Have seen better
Very beautiful place
This is not yet the place where you'll find quality service.
Parisian Starbucks are the very epitome of disorganization.
Really friendly bar near Nation.
Good wine and good platters :)
You'll find Japanese-style revamped eclairs and also renowned "strawberry cakes"
If you're a savoury friend you'll love the latest onigiri and bento.
If you are nice, they serve until 3 p.m. on Sundays.
Delicious savory tarts and the best lemon meringue pie in the world!
Pretty good but I wouldn't say it's the ultimate eatery.
The service was warm and welcoming even for a Saturday night.
The best Chinese restaurant in the 13th arrondissement‚Ä¶perhaps in all of Paris.
The Phnom Penh soup is delicious, the beef luc lac is excellent.
And it's all inexpensive.
You've got to be on board with the cafeteria atmosphere though.
I waited in line for about 25 minutes on a Saturday evening but it was worth it.
The "mara√Æch√®re" crepe was excellent.
Best crepe I've ever eaten.
The waiter is very kind but card payment isn't accepted.
The atmosphere...,..but beware it's a bit more expensive in comparison to other places around and for those in the know, it's one of the only restaurants in Paris that doesn't take credit/debit cards!!!!
Only average dishes and too fatty.
Unpleasant management.
Great relaxed atmosphere with DJ on the weekends
Try the cocktail with cucumber as well as the selection of rums.
I recommend, absolutely delicious and excellent service.
The wait was well worth it.
And don't forget your classic waffles as you leave, they are an absolute must:-)
A classic Parisian brasserie
Beautiful art-deco restaurant (undergoing renovation) with its dome.
Excellent Parisian service.
Succulent meat cooked to perfection
The place is cool, the staff not so much...
The caramel frappucino is delicious
Hot chocolate and tart for an afternoon snack!
Cheap beers, serious cocktails, a cellar that smells of vomit and a new waitress making her debut in mental arithmetic: The recipe of a fabulous evening!
THE rooftop for an unbeatable view of Paris, not too high or too low.
Magical at night!
Very well thought-out interior decoration, no problem with the service, however, it‚Äôs very expensive.
The canap√©s are good but they should rethink the size of the small punch.
Excellent dishes, super friendly welcome, will be back!
Come early to devour all the sweet tarts!
It's really sad when there's no lemon meringue left when you arrive!
Take in the scenery and fight your way to the bar to order a beer.
The waiter is insufferable and rude.
A total schmuck.
It's expensive: drink + cake deal is around ‚Ç¨12.
But the service is friendly and the lemon tart is massive...
I like their homemade hot chocolate (‚Ç¨5.50).
Laptops not allowed.
Everything has already been said about their excellent burgers, but a special mention for the perfect service from beginning to end.
Servers available, attentive without being invasive!
Perfect!
Great, friendly atmosphere.
And of course we ordered the queso fundido along with our pre-dinner mojito!
A perfect place to take a break and enjoy a Japanese pastry and tea.
A mind-blowing view of Paris.
A fresh, modern restaurant.
Excellent service, very reactive staff, original burgers of good quality.
Don't forget the naan cooked in front of you... very good!
Pretty crappy.
Pretty unpleasant server. Noisy place.
Decent burger but sold at the price of oil.
Draught beer selection is poor.
I soon wondered what I was doing here.
Lots of love.
A pint was priced at ‚Ç¨2.90 during Happy Hour instead of ‚Ç¨2.50 ... but it's still pretty cheap üòä.
Free couscous on Thurdays!!!
Nice d√©cor, good Mexican food, good quality to price ratio
Impolite staff, tables not cleaned and the staff complained when we asked them to do it. Dirty glasses and cutlery.
Such a fun concept!
But you'll be cutting it close during your lunch break!
Count on waiting at least 30 minutes for the pizza and pasta
The terrace is very nice, somewhere not to be missed in Lille for those little pleasures.
For the Mont-Blanc with chestnuts üòç
You have to try the onion soup!
Fresh naans cooked in front of you, nice service and good Indian dishes
The perfect place to wait for your train and listen to good music.
Better for the atmosphere than the food
Nice, chic and relaxed for a drink‚Ä¶only problem the music is overbearing
Can't go wrong, fabulous terrace.
Enjoy Happy Hours on May 21st, 22nd and 23rd from 6pm to 8.30pm, with mouth-watering "velout√© sweet potato pumpkin coffee"
Try the Pho beef soup, the grilled specialties or the Bobun
Since December, it's gotten worse and worse.
I would have recommended it before, but not now.
Always packed but really good!
One thing explains the other.
The tapenade du bossu
Enormous dishes and low prices.
Great authentic Basque cuisine!
If you take a salad, you'll find yourself eating the whole bowl.
But it's delicious and the atmosphere is really nice.
Drinking tea and eating a waffle here, it's so classy‚Ä¶ @<ID>
Perfect for breakfast, lunch or dinner, Le Chat Bossu offers excellent bistro dishes.
Special mention for the burger, always a hit!
Always quick service and very good value for money
A bar serving Murphy's stout!!
The leek and Auvergne blue cheese tart is very, very good!!
Incredibly devoted to quality dough and very creative with toppings.
These pizzas all start with a wholesome dough.
A quality choice of cocktails with or without alcohol, generous and well-served, well balanced!
The setting is really nice, and comfortable, no problems there, in fact, quite the opposite!
Smeared glasses, cold burgers, soft bread.
The mustard may be good, but still, don't go.
The hanger steak and fries are succulent
The waiting staff vary quite a lot‚Ä¶
Impressive selection.
The doryaki are good but not great.
The matcha brioche's a treat.
Blind test on Wednesday evenings!
Terrible toilets to avoid at all costs
Great with a really laid-back atmosphere.
To take a drink with rats and cockroaches around. It's not great.
Too bad as the service is pretty cool!
Great little garden at the back.
Perfect for smokers.
With waiter service on the terrace when the weather's fine.
No point in calling, they don't take reservations.
Very good dishes and a great wine selection
Cozy atmosphere, delicious milkshakes (the Janis) and very tasty burgers and sandwiches (the turkey sandwich)!
A D√¥me restaurant location = small space, quick-service, and average quality
A real Japanese restaurant with an excellent chef making excellent sushi!
A stone‚Äôs throw from the UGC, ideal for a quick drink before or after the cinema...
Reasonable price for the Champs Elysee. The tables are so tightly packed, it seems a bit like a canteen, but the pizzas are good.
Intimate, minimalist, cool and with delicious coffees.
I love the coffee with cream
ESCALOPE DE VEAU MONTAGNARDE is an absolute knock out and you'll have difficulty recovering
Known to make the best Ramen in the capital, we weren't disappointed. It was perfect.
Be prepared to wait to eat here. The restaurant has a maximum of 20 covers.
If you‚Äôve just got back from koh lantha then yes, but if not it‚Äôs to be avoided
Cool menu, this place left a fine impression üòâüíã
Waiting again and again
Good but not incredible.
A bit disappointed given all the hype written about this place... the meat is even thinner than at MacDonald's, the secret sauce tastes a bit like Algerian kebab sauce...
Good portions, but pasta reheated with the sauce. Not freshly prepared which you should expect given the price. So, personally, very, very average value for money.
The menus are really well-priced but only at lunchtimes.
A bit cold in winter, but a hot atmosphere when there's DJ events and evenings.
The foie gras pizza sits heavy
It‚Äôs really noisy and not so easy to find somewhere to sit.
But it‚Äôs better than Starbucks!
Classy decor, cozy atmosphere with low lighting and drinks at low price
Order the bento of the day, it's a telltale meal.
And the raspberry cheesecake for dessert.
Very expensive, small quantity but very good
I took your advice and allowed myself to be tempted by the Cat Burger and I don't regret it a bit, delicious!
La Coupole is the largest brasserie in Paris.
I expected something large, so I am a bit disappointed.
Very expensive dishes and restaurant with no atmosphere.
The pastrami burger was delicious.
The desserts are expensive but very good!
Don't be too greedy and make sure you leave space for dessert‚Ä¶
The oscar menu is perfect!
One of my favorite spots in Paris.
Take the stairs down to the small courtyard.
A slice of rural paradise!
The African chocolate and the best hot chocolate in Paris.
Great burger (especially the BBQ +++) but the wait's far too long.
Allow for at least an hour's wait.
Great place to eat American-style!
Reasonable prices, pleasant decor and atmosphere.
It‚Äôs expensive and its not very good!
The only plus point is that you get to sit on a terrace in the station.
Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt go back to Express Bleu
It's very slow even when there aren't many people. Otherwise, in terms of quality, nothing to say.
I have just spend 20 minutes waiting, standing up.
Very good brasserie with nice people.
Recently renovated.
Worth a visit just for the Philippe Starck decor!
Flawless and charming service and a menu to suit everybody even if the prices are a bit high!
Also worth trying the desserts!
Nice bar, cool atmosphere and pleasant terrace, good burger but quite excessive drink prices: ‚Ç¨8 a pint!
As tasty as always, but the service was lousy today
Don't go without tasting their amazing hot chocolate.
Just the "Le loir dans la th√©i√®re" tea is worth the detour.
Hands down the best creperie in Paris.
Due to its success, however, the Josselin creperie is packed from morning to night.
Very very good burgers, not too far off from the place de la R√©publique and has both vegan and vegetarian options upon request üëç
Excellent pittas to eat on the go, great atmosphere, friendly...
Ideal for a Sunday evening with mates.
Best pittas on Rue des Rosiers!!
a wireless headset, three DJs playing at the same time, three vibes to choose from... The Silent Disco phenomenon has reached la Rotonde on the last Friday of every month.
Good, but a bit of a factory.
Don't even try without a reservation, its basically mission impossible. Not really recommended for a dinner for two, rather noisy atmosphere
Very good filter coffee!
The best place! But start off with something salty before trying out the rum flamb√© specialities for breakfast (otherwise you'll get a little tipsy)! Awesome and delicious though!
Ideal for a quick adventure to the USA, minus the plane ticket and the jet lag.
It's a shame there were no onion rings on the menu though‚Ä¶
For a "Platter" breakfast on red benches.
Recordings of the Montreux live sessions
A wonderful surprise situated in the middle of the 11th district!
The desserts are not to be missed!!
Very, very good and authentic cuisine
Brunch (for ‚Ç¨21) isn‚Äôt madness at all.
For this price they could at least give you real orange juice and chocolate chip brioche which isn‚Äôt stale :/
The best chocolate Snowball cake in Lille
The Mont-Blanc really is their specialty!
The setting is quite simply WOW.
Quick service, but not very smiley‚Ä¶
If you want a luxurious snack, this is the place to come!
(Get the Mont Blanc)
Try a vanilla waffle
Try the sauteed chicken. It's fabulous!
A relatively traditional menu but very good dishes.
Very popular at lunchtime. Go as early as possible!
The burger is enormous, but delicious!
And for dessert, the cheesecake is worth a try.
Small estaminet decor, good beers and well located in the heart of Vieux-Lille.
I usually love this place but tonight it was totally off.
Ordered an Astroblond beer and was served a Kirin instead‚Ä¶no apologies nor replacement.
Dessert: stale and dried out green tea cheesecake!
Food quite good, but the almost canteen atmosphere is disappointing for a date‚Ä¶
Avoid the place at lunchtime, it's jam-packed and their serving style makes for an unpleasant experience.
Delicious!!
Bakery that makes you want to be hungry and rich
How can such a charming place serve such mediocre food, it's terribly disappointing.
The venue is all wrong: insufferable music, mundane food.
Pathetic!
Adorable and kind service. :) Food not bad, the mash is really something.:)
Not even enough room for 15 people...
F**k!!!
The Parisian bento and the cheesecake = the perfect meal
Lol definitely not as good as <NAME>'s ;)
Exquisite little delights.
It's almost a pity to tuck in.
I prefer the Equinoxe.
The chocolate is excellent, the Saint Honor√© and mille-feuille delicious!
Platters, beer and atmosphere
Salmon, my favorite!
Original concept; the Toscane is very spicy!
Avoid it if you don't like very spicy food!
Beautiful, refined setting, the decor is quite baroque with old sofas and original lamps.
There is a discreet area with curtains for more privacy.
The waiters are unusually friendly.
Unmissable and historic!
Very good, service lived up to expectations.
Since the renovations, the restaurant feels a bit cold.
Still a good place to treat yourself!
Service is way off!!!
Unbelievable seeing waiters treating customers this way.
Good value for money for Paris.
The big salads are excellent.
The menu needs house fries
The #4sqday team was very poorly received :(
You have to be a bit patient to get a table and the waiters aren't always patient but the tarts are worth it!
Especially the MASSIVE lemon meringue pie!
I‚Äôd recommend the duck and pan-fried foie gras crepinette!
A little expensive but perfect for discovering little Japanese cuisine delights such as melon pan („É°„É≠„É≥„Éë„É≥).
Blood sausage, duck breast fillet, cr√®me br√ªl√©e.
Everything was great.
Fabulous place, excellent entrecote!
The potjevleesch is delicious.
The Welsh rarebit is made with Maroilles cheese.
Great dining in a lovely setting
They don't accept bank cards for reasons that are unclear‚Ä¶massive customer inflow, lots of tourists, it feels really cramped
Bollynan is really good, quite large portions and not too expensive.
I strongly recommend it for an Indian lunch.
Excellent Asian restaurant, everything is good and a fantastic setting, decorated by P. Starck.
Definitely get the Mr. the Governor, Rainbow Samoura√Æ and the Bubble Tea ‚ò∫
Stunning rotunda with a large, pleasant terrace at its foot to enjoy the nicer weather, a stone‚Äôs throw from the pool.
Happy Hour ‚Ç¨7.5 cocktails, ‚Ç¨5 for a pint (if not 9/ 6.5) Candle-lit and electro music in the evening
An endless wait!
The place to be for Arabs!
The Fouquet on the Champs Elysees is amazing but don't go into the bistro expecting to find any French locals, they'd rather not have coffee at Fouquet's!!
The staff was amazingly friendly and attentive.
I loved the galettes.
A strong Ethiopian coffee to start the afternoon
Certainly not expensive, the duck and cake were delicious
Excellent welcome from the barmen, relaxed atmosphere.
State of the art sound, played by a DJ.
Candle-lit, you can enjoy your privacy, with an original vintage d√©cor.
High quality cocktails.
Excellent value for money.
Great for those with small budgets who want to make the most of their evening in this neighbourhood!
The salads are around 9 or 10 euros even in the evening and the other dishes are similarly priced!
After a 50 minute wait (they said 15-20), we were EVENTUALLY seated.
The wait isn't worth it, to be avoided!
The calves tripe is excellent if you like tripe.
Nice atmosphere and good desserts. Instant relaxation after work.
For me, the best Ramen in all of Paris!
Little bit of advice for lunchtime: arrive before midday to stand a chance of getting a table‚Ä¶ Ittadakimasu! \o/
Are you a Lyria TGV customer and holder of a 1st class fleible ticket?
Enjoy a personalised welcome at Lyriacorner, located in the Montreux Jazz Caf√©, Monday to Friday 06:30 to 12:30 and from 14:00 to 18:30
Amazing location, especially in the evening üòâ
This used to be the place to be.
It‚Äôs just another tourist trap now like any other.
Only the view is really worth it.
Better for an evening drink than a meal.
Still just as good and cool after all these years.
Their burgers of the day are really great and surprising
Good food, the concept is great and if you're lucky you may get a fantastic waitress.
Negative point: very expensive:
as soon as it opens up after work, I head over here. It's one of my favorite cafes and it reminds me of Rue Saint Laurent in Montreal.
Super place to have a good burger and poached eggs.
A very long wait to finally tell us there was no more tables.
Around 30¬∞C and its not possible to give us a glass of water while we wait, wtf?
No opinion on the food, I left before that.
Superb set-up, ambiance a little noisy, cocktails a bit stingy but delicious.
The passion fruit and raspberry tart is superb!!!!!
Futuristic setting, good music and superb view of Paris.
A "Sud-Ouest" brasserie that's excellent value for money.
Good and authentic dishes!
Superb atmosphere!
The menu changes regularly.
I have yet to be disappointed!
One of the waitresses has burn scars on the underside of her wrist.
The soup is rather fatty.
Ask for <NAME>.
I'd try the Miso next time.
Good, but not very subtle.
Always impeccable
Perfect location, one of the canal‚Äôs real institutions!
Talk about expensive!
I suggest you order their hot chocolate and their marvelous Mont Blanc.
And then what?
Time for a siesta.
The cheese and caramelised onion fries are unreal!
One of my favorite places in the world.
Very noisy, even in August‚Ä¶
The midday set menus are Excellent!
Original menu and delicious food, same for the cocktails especially the cucumber one.
Just delicious!
Pitta bread to die for...
So moist!
For an informal lunch on the go ;)
Good but a little expensive (‚Ç¨9 a pint of beer after 11pm)
Calm at last, ideal for a glass of wine to wrap up the day
Generous servings, homemade fries, good drinks menu and a great atmosphere. Don't miss it.
Personal opinion: I prefer this one to the one in Jussieu.
Otherwise, the same opinion: good value for money and burgers that meet the Parisian standard, but with the advantage of not seeming pretentious.
Excellent bo bun, super efficient service! A great spot
One of my go-to canteens.
Come grab a coffee @<ID> it's just around the corner ÓêÖ
Huge burgers, excellent quality
A really nice new terrace.
It's changed. There didn't use to be glitter.
A real Japanese restaurant popular among Japanese people!
Afternoon or evening bar, to spend ten minutes or two hours.
Full on weekend evenings.
Authentic northern brasserie with delicious dishes!
Watch out, le pied de cochon will be closed at night from now on.
Their operating hours are unclear, but it's probably closed early in the morning‚Ä¶
Bursting with people , shoulder to shoulder!
May stop serving at 1 o'clock without warning then yell at the customers.
But the mere sight of Elise is worth all these sacrifices.
It's all very sweet‚Ä¶
much ado about nothing
Excellent, but it‚Äôs a long wait to be served.
If you like eggs, go nuts!
Authentic Japanese!
The yakitori sticks haven't been frozen and the sashimi's really fresh.
You don't pay much for authentic Japanese.
Try the cinnamon hot chocolate :D delicious!!!
After a first try that didn't go well, the second was unfortunately no better: food just OK, small portions, and the staff were not very friendly.
Satisfying crepes, speedy service, they don't take reservations.
Reasonable rices, just a shame the service is not so friendly.
The V√©g√©tarien was rated 2/5 by FatFood!
The bo luc lac isn't too pricey.
An endless wait for a really terrible burger, totally ordinary buns, soft and uncooked French fries and it wasn‚Äôt exactly cheap.
Basically a place to avoid there really are other better options.
Fantastic Thai restaurant in Belleville
Delicious food, rustic design, efficient service‚Ä¶Even the Bretons can feel at home here.
As for the brunch, it was ok, however, in the evening if like me you don‚Äôt like mice scampering over your feet, run!
There are mice everywhere in the evening, and they think it‚Äôs normal!
Average quality, the bread was cold.
Pretty good, but not worth the hour's wait.
Do you love New York-style bagels?
You're in the right place.
All the faces from FredFarid spend a day at Jeanette's, keep an eye out!
Definitely one of the best Japanese restaurants in Paris!
Really greasy
Incredibly slow service even though the terrace was half-empty.
Rice was drowning in butter.
To put it briefly, I regret coming in here.
The service is average.
The place to be after work apparently!
Small, charming and friendly tearoom for a nice time with your friends :)
The best burrata!!!!!
Crap bar and the waiters are assholes.
Massive solliciting as you pass by, for a pint at ‚Ç¨9.80.
Their fake side comes through as soon as you sit down (very cramped) ...
5 mistakes during one dinner (wrong starter, dessert before the main course, meat cooked wrong, wrong dessert, then the bill).
The service and the dishes don't live up to the standard of the setting and the reputation
Don‚Äôt ask for spicy and watch what they put in their woks ;) as it isn't always what's written on the menu.
Board games but the bar is too hipster
Really nice bar in Belleville.
Everybody's outside when it's hot.
The crepes are very good but due to the massive customer inflow, the service can leave something to be desired (I had to ask for a pitcher of water 3 times).
Not fruit juice (Tropicana) but what was totally ridiculous was the waiter‚Äôs response when I pointed out that a COCKROACH had fallen onto my table from the skylight: ‚Äúwell that‚Äôs not our fault that‚Äôs the station‚Äù!
A very busy establishment and often hyped for its burgers, which are in fact mediocre.
Industrial buns, no sauce, garnish just average.
The fries aren't worth the trouble
The best burger in Paris!!
I‚Äôm an adult and I‚Äôll do whatever I please with my little body.
‚Ç¨10 for lunch menu!
Includes a bowl of cider, a savory crepe, a sweet crepe
Really lovely decor, great dishes (delicious salmon)
One of the only genuine Japanese cafes in the district.
This place is small, you have been warned.
Their specialties are the Takoyakis, a sort of ball of octopus and fried tofu.
I recommend the flank steak and the baked apple, seeing as they don't have any daily specials left.
Consider ordering the pitcher of fresh fruit juice!
The sticky chocolate cake isn't bad at all
The best crepes in the 14th arrondissement, in all of Paris even!
A great find, the menus are a bit expensive but they‚Äôre almost as good as at a burger chain.
A large place with really fast service
They don't take credit/debit cards!
Long queue to order and the same to collect your burger!
But it's sure worth it!
I think they've changed the fries but I still thought they were great!
Drop all the airs and graces and the waiter will treat you like a loyal customer.
Chic canteen with an ethnic Bobo design, ultra-fresh Japanese-inspired dishes, and emerging organic trends.
Large array of bentos to eat on-site or for take-away.
The service leaves something to be desired.
This place is always full as it's inexpensive for the district.
You eat correctly here.
An obligatory wait outside.
They only seat full groups.
Avoid coming in a odd numbered group, all the even number groups will go ahead of you.
Once you're seated, enjoy!
Generous servings for the price but don't expect anything glamorous‚Ä¶
Le Diane for a two-chef dinner: keep an eye on their schedule because <NAME> likes inviting a wingman to share a moment of culinary art.
The Bbq Burger is my favorite.
Come check out <URL>
Since I've been to my fair share of Starbucks, I was itching to visit this one‚Ä¶friendly staff and very decent coffee.
Fabulous seating and design.
I am one happy Starbucks fan ;)
The traditional Mont Blanc and the chocolate frapp√© are delicious and simply the definition of a happy afternoon.
‚Ç¨16 brunch, crazy value for money!
But the service is a bit rushed...
They were gently encouraging us to leave! ;-)
Lovely setting, a bit noisy for dinner, but perfect for pre-dinner drinks with friends
I tried last week's pot au feu and was disappointed‚Ä¶ otherwise it's a really nice establishment...
Variable atmosphere (just like the waiters) but it's still a super terrace and not to be missed when you're out in Rue de la Gait√© !
Always a queue in the evenings after 7:30 but no problem if you're an early bird.
Carrot cake and one with eggplant.
I often eat here.
Good value for money and the pizzas are wood fired.
Very good value for money, almost too perfect! It's too copious.
Very good service, nothing more to say apart from the fact that you can't pay by debit/credit card
The upstairs seating area is really nice and cozy.
The teahouse is a favorite among expats.
Order the chocolate-raspberry.
Perfect for a little Scandinavian break.
Few tables in the large outdoor courtyard, so even when full the place stays peaceful.
It was good, it was organic, but boy did it take long‚Ä¶
Awesome place, inside and out... I love it!
Even if it‚Äôs not all that it‚Äôs still pretty good!
The service isn‚Äôt up to the standard you would expect of the place.
Very slow preparation.
Most of the time there‚Äôs only one register open
Have yourself a Parisian breakfast
The Crazy Banana is amazing!!!
Enjoy everything while you watch the world go by on Grand‚ÄôPlace <3
Ideal for a tea break.
The homemade cakes are delicious
Couldn't be more disappointed, the meals and prices have totally changed.
The meals and desserts are no longer homemade. The market caf√© has become a tourist trap.
Without a doubt the best value for money restaurant in the district!
And, when the weather's nice, they give out white straw hats, and that's cool!
The burgers are just great!
Maddeningly long wait to use the restroom!
Having a single restroom in this large-sized Starbucks is absurd.
I love this 'secret garden', a Scandinavian oasis in the middle of Paris.
Really zen spot to lose yourself on a Sunday.
Best (real) Japanese restaurant in Paris.
Plan to wait for a long time, but other than that, it's a nice place to have an out-of-the-ordinary coffee
The prices are ‚Ç¨4 higher than in Germany‚Ä¶
But it's still a good concept
A bar that does the job
Great restaurant at affordable prices however the new waitress is a real idiot.
The quality is there as in the other Vapianos but the waiting time at busy periods is very long!
Good tea and delicious desserts.
Small downside: plan to wait at least a quarter of an hour before getting a table for afternoon tea...
Asian cuisine restaurant, a bit artistic with original cocktails and stylish d√©cor.
Booking essential in the evening.
‚ô• Super bar by the Saint Martin Canal.
There‚Äôs a nice little terrace and the decor inside is beautifully vintage.
Reasonable prices for bobo-world!
All you have to do now is find a somewhere to sit :)
Very good burger, fries not so good, not too expensive and good portions.
Go after 3 o'clock to beat the crowds.
Perfect service, good food.
The cheesecake is disappointing (a far cry from the traditional recipe) but the rest is well worth a visit!
Best value for money in the district with heated terrace in winter.
Often packed but great Parisian HQ
Better off making a reservation, long lineup!
Quite unusual place
The cocktails are revisited classics with sake, and it works well.
Not been able to test the food yet, it's always full.
Though I'm not a big fan of the lemon tart, this one here is spectacular!
The flan is also incredible.
The only appeal of this brasserie is that it's open all night and is right in the heart of Paris.
Other than that it's very average quality, even the pork.
It's good but wait times drag on and on‚Ä¶
Grab a bite or a beer in the 10th arrrondissement.
It has to be one of the best Japanese restaurants in Paris.
Don't let appearances fool you‚Ä¶
The pizzas are much better than the look of the place would have you think!
Great pizzas but the place leaves something to be desired‚Ä¶
Very good coffee, approximately ‚Ç¨5.
The apple crumble + a red fruit tea, which I liked. <3
The quality is dropping but the queue is getting longer.
What‚Äôs more, service is definitely declining, basically, it‚Äôs not what it was!
R.I.P BIA
Very good and affordable, the place is great too.
The weekend bento is super fresh (the yuzu cream is out of this world) and the bento salmon is yummy.
It's a good place, plain and simple!
This place is simply spectacular!
Really great bar, ‚Ç¨2.50 a pint during HH (normally ‚Ç¨4.00) free couscous around 9pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays!
Best hot chocolate in Paris.
Shameful service (the servers would rather clear empty tables than serve customers) + desserts are 2x smaller before closing (equally priced of course) = I strongly advise you not to go!
I've tasted better waffles.
I found Meert's a bit too buttery and too sweet.
Large pleasant terrace and low prices! Cocktails at ‚Ç¨5.50 all night long!!!
***Restaurant / Service Dining / Eat-in - Burger specialists with a delicious bun, a nice thick cut of meat and cooked perfectly!
Come for the pastrami and cheesecake too!
The service on the indoor terrace is terrible.
If it‚Äôs not how slow it is, than it‚Äôs the absolute lack of manners shown by the waiter and if you stay then there‚Äôs a rip off waiting on the bill!
The owner's breath stinks
I heard that sushi and maki are really good.
Service is still very slow. Terrace isn't closed off, so it's very cold‚Ä¶
Fusion cuisine, Asian tendencies, quite nice
Chef's salad and baked camembert!
The beef tartare and the duck confit are very tasty.
20 cents for ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù customers to use the toilets!
Clearly one of the best bagels in Paris.
But a very small place! ‚Ç¨5.90 for bagel + drink.
For dessert: the Oreo cake or the Nutella bagel ;)
Their small plates and salads can be enjoyed on the terrace.
The prices are realy reasonable for such a nice place.
Well, it's not fab, but not over priced for the Champs and open all night so +1
Fair trade coffee for lovers of refined products from countries all over the world
Not great to see mice running along behind the bar
The veal escalope with mushroom cream makes it easier to wait until the veal chop with chanterelle mushrooms is in season ;)
A lively atmosphere typical of the 20th century.
Superb salad in what is frankly a massive venue with high ceiling.
Really nice waiter. You might think you were at home.
Very reasonably priced given the quality.
The service is as bad as can be and the menu goes on and on, which raises doubts about product freshness.
Great food and teriffic staff
Just for the posers out there.
Very beautiful place but avoid going for brunch, there are not enough things.
Cheese cut as thin as cigarette paper is not worth the ‚Ç¨22 - it's better to order salads and quiches, and then something sweet
super good sweets
I‚Äôd recommend the ‚ÄúChocolate Merveilleux cake" but don‚Äôt plan on eating anything afterwards, you‚Äôll be full for a fortnight!
Restaurant with unique appetiser-main course-dessert.
Authentic hipster vibe.
good and not too expensive. sweet crepes have been tested and approved. Very friendly service.
The Welsh rarebit with Maroilles cheese (ask for it without meat if you are vegetarian) is simply amazing.
The service is super friendly!
I‚Äôve experienced warmer welcomes, but the new autumn/ winter menu is really quite nice.
Special mention for the roast duckling and the creme brulee trio!
Lovely place to have a snack in peace and quiet :) Very good coffee and yummy homemade cakes
The equinox cake and the fruit tarts are marvelous.
No matter what anyone says, this is where you'll find the best chocolate eclairs in Paris.
The chocolatine (chocolate croissant) is delicious, as is their sesame bread roll
A wonderful restaurant, friendly service, delicious meals, and dining in the inner courtyard is a must in the summer.
Cooking full of flavour.
The service, however, is not so great
Don't miss the ratatouille, which is nothing like the Provence version!
excellent, very savory blends
The perfect place to spend some time either on your own or with friends, to just relax or get some work done in style!
The noodles
Nice setting but average food and pretty slow service.
Better for a drink than something to eat.
Red wine: have the Lascaux
Personal bartender, giant fridge, vinyl-covered wall, red bench seats, wafting burger aroma‚Ä¶
It's got all you need for a brunch with friends or family.
The white or milk hot chocolate has to be tried.
Excellent place for tourists looking for Paris in the 1900s.
You'd be better to go to the Galeries Lafayettes one, much cleaner.
For me, Schwartz means pastrami, amazing pastrami sandwich
The rest is also very good, very generous and affordable.
Very good coffee, but really stuck-up ambiance.
Prefer the lounge to upstairs!
The freshly squeezed grapefruit is amazing!!!
yummmmm everything is good... but there‚Äôs not much room!
Quite expensive and the waiters aren't very friendly.
On the other hand, the lemon meringue pie is unmissable.
And the place is cozy!
Pretty good pizzas.
A varied menu with higher prices for the more sophisticated pizzas.
There are better pizza parlors nearby.
The service is slow and very unpleasant.
The pastries may be good, the bread however is disappointing; you can find better baguettes at a lesser price
Takoyaki, fast service, delicious!
The people too
Large variety (and quality) of coffees: perfect for coffee-lovers ‚ù§Ô∏è Service is a bit abrupt (bored tone & vague recommendations).
Lactose-free options (as well as dairy-free milks) would be appreciated
20 minutes' wait for 1 cappuccino and 1 espresso :/
Slow slow slow! And the waiters aren't very friendly!
The biggest outrage in a long time!!!
The portions are ridiculously overpriced and inedible!
Typically Parisian for the typical Parisian
Very nice restaurant, the prawns just delicious and undeniably good service.
I'd come back, even if the price is a bit steep!
Good-quality coffee, but the same can't be said for the service.
The Lemon Bar Cr√®me Frappuccino (with iced tea) is not all bad: it makes for a welcome change from coffee this spring!
Very good menu, well worth while for a dinner for two or with friends.
Good value for money, good time had, I would willingly recommend!
One of the best value for money places in Paris.
Really fresh ingredients and a pretty garden.
Not great but not expensive
The waiters change every couple of days and nearly always do a bad job.
Rich and delicious cheesecake.
I can't wait to go back.
Noisy during the weekends, quite small, but great food and really affordable prices.
Not bad for an Italian. However "fast" food to rethink. Best not to be in a hurry‚Ä¶
I love the idea of the food prepared in front of you and the pasta is good!
Nice soft bread, almost like Shake Shack! ;)
Mint tea on the terrace!
Rapid service, a bit too robotic.
But the flammenkuchen aren't bad
The rib steak is the best!
The gourmet coffee is a real treat.
An authentic Parisian brasserie ;)
Especially for the desserts‚Ä¶
Philippe Starck d√©cor, quick and friendly service and food that is out of the ordinary üëå
Surly waitresses‚Ä¶
Good but excessive prices for a meal on the go
The caramel pear tatin is a true taste sensation :-)
Montagnarde veal escalope!!!
Bourguignon sandwich!
The wait staff will be hard pressed to serve you in less than an hour no matter the weeknight you go in.
Great to enjoy a drink.
Cool and relaxed.
Really nice bar that's not expensive. Plus you can mess with the waiters.
You can order a plate of fries for ‚Ç¨4.00.
A real gem in this neighbourhood.
Avoid this place at all costs.
Disgusting crepes similar to the frozen kind (which are probably better, by the way) and obnoxious waitresses with almost zero talent for customer service!
Have a coffee and write in a cool atmosphere (:
The roses are now made of fabric...
I want to go there again!
A perfect trip to America!
No, no, no. Too good a restaurant to share!
If you go you won't be able to resist going back especially for its lovely garden not to mention the varied menu and great prices e.g. Salad around ‚Ç¨11
Friendly waiters, but the food sits a bit heavy
Come early, it's busy.
Help yourself to the brown tea.
Sunny in the evening
The lounge can be made private for up to 18 people
New d√©cor and pretty lighting.
Perfect for lunch with friends.
1 day a Japanese lady was speaking next to me about: "the best Gyozas and the best Ramen".
Curious, I asked where?! (here).
You have to wait (same as everywhere) but it's worth it!!
Fat and tasty, so GOOD!
Discover this patisserie in Paris offering great cakes with unusual flavours.
The decor's not bad but a little greasy
Yuzu and matcha eclairs: a real delight! üòã
Fast and friendly service, despite how busy it is
Lovely bar/brasserie, great food!
Ask for Triple C, their tasting beer, and you're sure to have a good evening!
Massive lemon tart and very good cakes!
But it's still too expensive for this burger quality.
Even so, it's still better than McDonald's
Watch out for the pigeon with the swollen foot...
It‚Äôll eat your muffin, not just the crumbs and isn‚Äôt afraid of anything!
Super cozy, you feel good here‚Ä¶
The cucumber and basil cocktail is awesome!
Very professional and welcoming staff!
Safe bet for a date or with mates:)
Good, but I've had better.
They're damn expensive, even for Paris.
Very small place but excellent bagels.
If you are still a bit hungry after the cheesecake, there is always the little store with products that come directly from over there!
Nice pastries and meals.
The omelettes are really good :)
The suzette crepe is excellent.
We've been going to this restaurant for years, but this time, we were very disappointed with the fillet.
Delicous though a bit pricey :)
A rare find in Paris.
A warm spot in the winter with hot drinks, cakes and quiches‚Ä¶ all at a good price.
In good weather they have a beautiful terrace :-)
Great Chinese food :-) I love it!
Very affordable prices given the district
Very good, but service and d√©cor outdated :(
Stuffy, but very nice restaurant!
There are much better pizza parlors in the neighborhood now.
Fresh meat with good cheese.
The French fries and house sauce absolutely hit the spot.
Ask for the secret triple menu if you think you can handle it!
The lemon tart is a must, but the other desserts and savory tarts are absolutely delicious.
Nice setting, very cozy, good cocktails (around 12‚Ç¨) and good service!
Don‚Äôt show up without a reservation after 7 p.m., you won't be welcomed :-(
There‚Äôs nothing good about this Starbucks
And they charge for this?!!!
Speedy service and excellent galettes.
The place is very busy, it's not uncommon for the lineup to extend outside.
The inner space is perfectly optimized to fit as many people as possible.
The best! Especially the bobun!! Must-try and, most importantly, very affordable.
Beware, they don't accept bank cards or meal tickets
The great classic: waffles.
Best in the world!
Really nice decor!
And a great cheesecake!
It wouldn‚Äôt be in my top 5 but it would be no.6 ^^ muahahaha it's really good! I recommend it :)
The napoleon and the artisanal chocolate‚Ä¶omg
Good burgers, much less greasy than what you find in other places.
The French fries are thin and really great and the prices are like at MacDonald's, so a great alternative!
The lemon meringue pie is just incredible.
I came across this beautifully decorated bar near to home. The service is not that great and it's a bit of an assembly-line!
Mind-blowing creperie!
Great pastries but the service is a bit unfriendly
If you only have one Sunday brunch in Paris, make it Breakfast in America‚Ä¶ but come early, before 11!
A must-see in Montpart for starting or ending your evening.
Not far from the MammaFashion Boutique (35 rue de Cotte), undoubtedly the prettiest shop for maternity and breastfeeding in Paris.
Always a full house and yet they only have a single toilet!!
But the staff is friendly.
Enjoying a dessert in this setting is pure bliss!
Great breakfast place with the best squeezed orange juice in the world, ahh!
Very nice welcome in a lovely place, if a bit noisy.
The burgers are delicious and enormous: it took me almost an hour to finish mine!
Superb Thai restaurant in Belleville.
Everything is good, a very complete menu, cool service.
The drinks aren't too expensive, but the place is a bit lacking in character.
Go preferably in the summer and during nice weather to enjoy the garden.
The rest of the time it's cool.
A nice place for a drink, a quick bite to eat or a meal.
Make the most of the terrace as soon as the sun is out.
Very very very delicious sweets!!
(the chocolate pear crumble is a delight!!)
Good burgers and the cheese fries are not bad at all :)
Very friendly atmosphere and attentive staff but the cocktails are really disgusting!
Delicious cocktails
Free couscous on Thurday evenings!
Soup (tomato and basil in February) is really delicious.
Homemade and served hot: the only regret is that it's not fitting with the season! üçÖ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Ramen really, really good.
The miso is more than delicious.
Advice: ask them to add more broth to make it lighter.
Perfect Gyozas!
An Asian take on fast food: rapid service, tasty, and inexpensive!
The restaurant is split in two areas, the smaller area is often emptier than the larger.
The crepes are pre-made, probably elsewhere, the prices are high, the terrace is the only good part
Their steamed specialties are good, the coconut rice dumpling is very soft.
Escargots, Escalope montagnarde, Basque gateaux :) The best !!!
The honey camembert is perfect with an aperitif!
I love it but I'm already an out-and-out Cyril Lignac fan!!
I wanted to see him but he wasn't there :((
SUPER STRONG mojitos.
Trashy atmosphere, a little better outside - despite the neighbors.
Delicious, excellent brunch, complete change of scenery!
In April 2016, La Caf√©oth√®que announced (on social media) that they were now offering alternatives to cow's milk (plant milks).
I was there yesterday and they didn't have any
It closed down :(
A super good and cheap Indian.
Naan made to order in the traditional way.
And prime vegetarian dishes.
For a lunch on the go in the Montorgueil area.
Well-kept, old-fashioned atmosphere but very touristy and quality of cakes very mediocre (very disappointing Mont Blanc!)
Tiny restaurant that looks like nothing at all, but the service is fast and friendly.
Expect an out of the ordinary Ramen, rich in flavors, but also very fatty!
I recommend the "maigre" broth
Large dishes and not at all pricey.
They're great.
However, you might find the food's a bit rich, (too many sauces and potatoes with everything) recommended for groups because there's a lot of room. Similar to Gladines.
An authentic Japanese restaurant. Outstandingly fresh!
Bagels like in the United States!
Raspberry Mont Blanc: üëçüèª
Delicious salmon skin maki!
For the free glass of wine, it's only on the 1st Tuesday of the month.
So, bring some Rose.
Voted best burgers in Paris.
Premium service that makes you feel at home, good music and cocktails that are just as delicious as the burgers, the fries, and the coleslaw.
Really nice ambiance. Very good music. Varied menu and well-made‚Ä¶ Fantastic cocktails‚Ä¶ We had a great evening!
Staff are unpleasant and the service is slow.
Excellent brunch: good products, more than generous portions, good service :)
Always so good and great service.
Always just as good, the perfect little break.
Just like the Ten Belles on the St Martin Canal, guaranteed good coffee, well served.
Legendary Lille waffles
The lemon meringue pie is a must, but it is giant.
The tea is delicious but plan to spend time in a queue before being able to get in.
Good Japanese pastries but prices are a little high.
No doubt one of the best creperies in Paris.
Satisfying galettes and fair prices.
Super atmosphere and great prices
An atypical place, generous brunch for the price (‚Ç¨21)
Ramen that tasted almost like the ones you get in Japan!
Little menu of 5 different Ramen! From 9-12‚Ç¨!
Good sized portion with option of doubling the noodles!
A flashback to Japan!
Lovely terrace and good service
Excellent Welsh rarebit with Maroilles cheese, reservation required :) very nice
Children's pizza 3.50‚Ç¨, great, it's big enough and it's fresh!
VERY friendly service, but they‚Äôve got a few things to iron out (first week!), a beautiful place
Excellent food, impeccable service, 20-30 euros for a main and dessert in the evening.
The place is very charming, the wait is a bit long but they redeem themselves with the amazing lemon tart and the choice of delicious teas!
Delicious espresso on the terrace facing the Grand Place: worth the trip!
Excellent green tea tiramisu, green tea cake and green tea roulade!
And loads of bentos #yum
I've never had service as terrible as today...
Although I was a regular at this place, I know I won't be back.
Attempt to seat us quickly, no friendliness.
Really nice but way too expensive!
I'd say "the best lemon tart in the world!!!"
Make the most of Happy Hour on May 21, 22, and 23 with the roasted cauliflower, hazelnut and nuoc mam sauce from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Nice place for a drink, a bit expensive to eat
The waiters would be better off chilling in the slammer
Very, very good scallops served with a salad.
The desserts do seem to be as good as the restaurant's reputation, but that's for next time‚Ä¶
Lovely restaurant, good service and quality menu.
Also with a deli just opposite filled with great products and also a wine cellar.
I just don't get the hype about this place.
Get away, nothing to see here.
The waitresses in mini-skirts are somewhat ridiculous, which is not the case for the prices which are beyond belief.
A restaurant that doesn't go very well with the spirit of the Aligre district.
Really cool but be careful with your belongings on the terrace, repeated thefts in summer 2012.
Laid back ambiance, good music, excellent cocktails‚Ä¶ wandering, first choice bar
Coffee for 1 Euro at the counter.
Incapable of hosting the 4sqDay.
Opt instead for La Terrasse!
A cozy place, but too busy. The desserts are good but the prices are too expensive.
Between cousins!
Yes, yes, family‚Ä¶ :-)
I celebrated my birthday here, the place is nice and drinks are inexpensive however downstairs smellt bad ...
The only place where you can get freshly roasted coffee in Lille
A nice location, the food wasn‚Äôt bad but the waiter was unbearable.
The technique?
To be even more unbearable.
He could do with a talking to.
Otherwise a great cheesecake, avoid the millefeuille.
You've got yourself an hour-long wait and prices that suggest quality, just to end up with some pretty mediocre food.
A miserable √©clair at ‚Ç¨5.50, I'll remember this, alright!
Thank god the service is ok‚Ä¶
Be patient as it‚Äôs always packed =_=
It's good, but nothing to write home about.
The place, taken over by a crowd of tourists with a slightly high average age‚Ä¶
Young people find somewhere else.
Everyone else, try another Angelina's.
Great service and a good continental breakfast for ‚Ç¨36.
Viennoiserie basket, juice, hot beverages, fruit salad, and yogurt.
It‚Äôs such a shame that you‚Äôre going for quantity over quality.
Bring back the time when you were a real local institution with <NAME> and without the frills!
A really delicious Japanese!
Ask for the veal pastrami!
The garden's a real little gem‚Ä¶ Beautiful, peaceful and filled with an abundance of greenery.
The best savory crepes in Paris in my opinion.
The sweet ones are also extremely good.
It's always jam-packed but the space is cozy.
Very romantic, perfect for a first date!
Fabulous inner garden.
Located between the Place de Clichy and La Fourche.
Coffee at ‚Ç¨1 in the restaurant or at the bar.
Where did the bars where you could get two pints with a ‚Ç¨10 bill go? #increase
Get a White russian!!!!
The team works fast despite the rush.
Friendly atmosphere, warm service and a good brunch for ‚Ç¨22.
The negatives: proximity of the tables
Burgers to die for
Nice, reasonable price, excellent rib steak ;)
Nice Korean restaurant.
The bulgogi is the best dish on the menu.
You should absolutely come for their lunch set menu which is great value for money.
Very friendly and welcoming, they make you feel comfortable. A must-try
Like all "cool" places in the capital, patience is required before going!
But it will be rewarded x10!
One of the best tearooms I've been to
If you want everyone to know it's your birthday, this restaurant is made for you!
After trying the all'arrabiata pasta, (delicious) I went for the bruschetta: can't say it was bad but I've had better, not crispy enough for my taste. The soups are great‚Äì ideal for winter
The hot chocolate is a bit too "creamy".
To be honest, it was nothing special: dry cheeseburgers, frozen French fries but that happens I guess the rushed out nachos were the same, queuing so long for that was a real waste of time
The famous American "In and Out"‚Ä¶ But French.
Maddeningly slow service, but their menu items are mouthwatering!
Fan of the brunch, this is an ideal spot to detox after a weekend of overindulging!
The baguette and the viennoiseries are truly delicious.
The sweets are wonderful and fairly priced!
Long wait times (even with a reservation) but excellent cuisine featuring all things pork.
A typical Parisian restaurant.
The bar is good but the waiters arent always
Typical dishes in an authentic decor...
Come here for a good Welsh rarebit.
The atmosphere is nice and welcoming.
‚Ç¨0.20 to use the toilet and ‚Ç¨4.30 for a pepsi.
More expensive
than 2 litres of unleaded petrol!
Best value for money for a Thai restaurant.
There are certainly better ones but they‚Äôre generally much more expensive.
Somewhere between Japan and Brazil is the rue de Paradis.
Try out the bento box of the day, it's a safe bet.
Laid back atmosphere, good music, excellent cocktails‚Ä¶wandering, not to be missed
The Welsh rarebit with Maroilles cheese is excellent!
Always a wait of around 20-30 min, but the result is great burgers unlike any others you'll find in Paris!
A beautiful garden, ideal to escape the hustle and bustle of Paris
Shame we couldn't make a reservation, but I guess that's the price of success!
Get there early in the evening.
Good classic dishes, a bit expensive but well-prepared.
Beautiful terrace, service ok.
NB: Red fruit pavlova, the jar of chocolate mousse and the superb fries :) a bit disappointed by the lemon tart.
2 hours 15 minutes waiting in line just for a burger‚Ä¶
Not only is the restaurant really nice (I love the decor) and well situated but it's also very good!
Special mention for the cotton candy dessert: deliciously regressive;
The Macaroons are a bit on the expensive side...
Restaurant that stands out with its plant d√©cor, overlooked by a mezzanine to continue the evening.
Food not bad and cocktails good.
Dishes not bad at all and very beautiful space.
The seafood platter is OK but not as good as those at the Le Dome or Dorr.
The most beautiful sushi in Paris for those willing to pay for it.
An excellent cafe, passionate service, a place of good taste to visit in Paris.
In the center of Lille, a genuine cake shop with delicious waffles...
The coffee is good here, and comes from the four corners of the world.
Be careful as on the weekend there's a very long wait for your drink.
Excellent pastries and very friendly staff!
It has become very hipster all of a sudden and has lost its authenticity a little bit (read: a lot) but whatever, it has a nice address in Faubourg Saint Denis
Lignac has a leg up in the game and keeps the clients coming.
The chestnut mandarin yule log is light and addictive.
Fine work right down to the packaging.
Good service, great food and excellent wine.
I feel really relaxed every time I'm here.
Excellent burgers and fries, but it's a bit on the expensive side given the ingredients used
Probably the best creperie in Montparnasse. It's always teeming with Parisians and tourists: you'll have to bide your time to be seated but it's well worth it!
The barbecued duck is always a treat
Best in rue St Anne and best value for money!
The waitresses are very friendly
Oyster/cocktail bar brought to you by the New-Yorkers behind Candelaria and Glass.
Beautiful place that's unfortunately a bit overrated and too expensive.
The burgers are good but I'm not a fan of their fries.
The food truck is next to a cinema and the library. A victim of its own success, don't complain if you have to wait a while.
Good quality to price ratio, warm welcome, and good well-garnished dishes.
Damn!
It's excellent but they don‚Äôt accept card payment!!!
For a drink on the terrace overlooking the Saint MartinCcanal.
Club chairs, a relaxed atmosphere, lots of English-speakers and most importantly, great coffee!
Cut in front of everybody to get your hands on the butter and salt-butter crepes :D
I'd love to lounge around on the cushions some Sunday at brunch
Delicious Dummoriers and Morizios.
Great Creation Cocktails
When the sun's out, the outdoor terrace is really fabulous.
You can't go wrong with the Salade des Dames (15 euros).
My new favorite creperie!
Get there early if you don‚Äôt want to wait in line.
Nice caf√© decorated in a Swedish style (anything else would be ridiculous).
We go there for the large outside terrace.
One of the best spots in the city!
The dishes are very light and not amazing, the prices are a bit steep but the setting is quite exceptional.
It's too bad that the burgers vary from day to day.
They're succulent one day, mediocre the next‚Ä¶
At least the mustards are always delicious.
I started to get fed up of the noise of the very lively and rude clientele, the lack of space...
But I have to say that the lamb kebab is really worth it
A must visit in Lille, a bit like Laduree in Paris.
Glamorous.
A nice place for a tasty brunch for a fantastic price (‚Ç¨25); the interior is delighful and the terraces are the perfect place to soak up some rays!
A delicious selection of macaroons with great seasonal flavours!
Never order the snapper!!!
Over 100 pizzas on the menu!
Service is a bit slow at noon but the staff is very friendly and the meals are worth the wait!
Bo bun lemongrass fish soup weeping tiger and lap kay chicken.
Everything was excellent!
Very very charming‚Ä¶
Very good and generous lemon tart! ‚Ç¨12 for the afternoon tea deal (tea + dessert)
Slowly but surely.
Better to take your time here.
The waiters are not restaurant professionals, that's for sure.
Respect for values: solidarity, traceability and quality for an exceptional coffee ‚òïÔ∏è
Nice place to have a good coffee and chat or read a book
No Happy Hour but pints are ‚Ç¨5.
Disappointing welcome.
Pushed towards the door well before closing time.
A bit past it
This is one of the most affordable restaurants in the luxurious Champs Elysee district.
French cuisine and you eat very well here!
Cafe, without frills, simply surrounded by a pleasant atmosphere and excellent team :) Breakfast is divine here!
Trendy, hipster, lots of people.
Good for a beer.
Quick and pleasant service, good, cheap
a lovely, original tearoom, which is not easy to find in Paris.
On the other hand, the service leaves a lot to be desired...
Best to arrive before 12.15pm to get a table
Incredible food and nice service.
Inventive but scrumptious pizzas ;)
Warning, the chili cheese fries, advertised as a side order, is a full meal for a regular European appetite ;)
Beware, the "African" hot chocolate is really chocolatey!
Have it or a cake, but not both!
You can't put a price on this sweet little treat!
Open until 8 p.m., a bakery and a confectionery in one!
Very good service and great burgers: a must-try in Paris!
Feels like you're immediately transported to the North-Atlantic coast!
Great bar for a change of scenery!
Good wine and delectable tapas!
Miss K≈ç is a restaurant created like the script of an unusual and hallucinatory experience.
A masterpiece, with Philippe Starck as the director and Miss K≈ç as the mysterious heroine.
The Montreux Jazz Caf√© opened on 20 November 2013 in Gare de Lyon, below the Train Bleu, on the site and instead of the Express Bleu.
A terrace overlooking the whole of Paris
The granola parfait is to die for :)
Very decadent tarts and charming setting
A beautiful view but the place is overrated, some of the hosts act like top models, the decor is cold, the menu is not so adventurous and there isn‚Äôt much value for money but the service is good
Top quality Matsu menu
Rice noodle soup with lacquered duck!
The breakfast isn't a hit (the cakes in particular)‚Äì better opt for Ladur√©e
Avoid the Dear Appolonia at all costs :(
Yummy, it's delicious, inexpensive and so kitsch :)
myths, nothing wrong here, pork and more pork

This is where the best cakes and hot chocolate in Pairs can be found.
Only problem, a bit noisy.
