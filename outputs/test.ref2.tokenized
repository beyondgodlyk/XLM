this person was the nicest i had ever spoken with .
the rest of their food isn 't edible but their employees and service are great .
as for the food , i 've had a lot of it .
however , the tech told me everything about this .

the man stopped her .
we told him that we wanted to finance .

we 've been to this long established restaurant never .
my plate was overflowing with food and especially the cole slaw .
when i arrived , everyone was at the desk .
we were served on time and it was very quick .

everyone else paid before they had their nails done .
i have ordered the benedict many times here and each time it keeps getting better !
i just loved this place so much .
an employee offered an apology , which i could tell was quite sincere .
there is a reason they can never seem to get you in fairly quickly .
are five stars possible ?
in the long run they did everything for me .
but let his story end at noon today .
seriously i always shop here .
it is absolutely the best place in the valley .
but their inventory was plausible !
the macaroni and cheese was gross , but the chicken was juicy .
he charged so little for them .

this place made me happy last time .
you can trust these people with a lease agreement .
make time to visit this place .

i called once and got a response .
they charged me appropriately for work done and parts installed .
it looks new and fresh .
he promptly called me back , as well .
if you travel , stay at this hotel .
i would rather wait for hot food than have it lukewarm and dry .
the food here is nicely flavored and unique and good .
this one is on the ball .
for the record , i am not a good cook , i don 't know how to use seasoning !
the tow package is a major concern , as well .
never crowded , so it 's not difficult to have a chance to actually have a good time .
i think it 's great when employees act that way .
i won 't be looking for a different salon .
you can count on my to shop here again .
the french toast plate was bad but the eggs were hot .
now the food : delectable and above average quality .

it was completed .
we plan to visit often .
he could actually read her pressure though .

it was something to be proud of for all involved , though i think he did notice .
i didn 't order my tires online or schedule an appointment .
hopefully , i take some bed bugs with me .
the beer is bad , but the food was less very desirable .
when it finally came out , it was good .

it 's a great college .
my jack and coke were great .
i will always eat at this place .
the falafel 's looked thick and lovely , and were very tasteful .

this one is a must visit .
i had no worries of being screwed over or ripped off .
we asked how long the wait would be , she said not long at all .
it 's well worth the cost for what you get .

and fortunately the nice woman also checked us out .
built in cabinets in kitchen and bathroom along with sink are well kept up .
exceptional service in these areas and really complemented our visit .
if i had wanted it washed i would not have washed it myself !
she grabbed my dirty dishes , and stayed and talked .
