then he proceeded to ask me how to fix it .

my wife came in for alterations and was treated quite well .
i resisted ordering a ceasar salad with a side of blackened chicken .
had it not been so perfectly cold , it would have been convenient .
she did not offer me a soda for my long wait .
i emailed to let them know and they cared very much .

management handled it .
i am surprised not more of these are opening up around the valley !

the beer is bad , but the food was great .
when it came out , it was great .
this is truly truth in advertising ; no need to call before you go !
