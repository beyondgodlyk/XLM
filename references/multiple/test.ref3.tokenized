don 't let the story begin today .
seriously though , i have shopped here before .
it is the absolute best place in the valley .
but their inventory was great .

she talks too much and never leaves .
the others ordered ribs that were tasty and moist .
the staff was everywhere .

go if at possible .
i definitely was not screwed over , or short changed .
we didn 't need to ask how long the wait would be , she readily told us a few minutes .
it 's just too good for what you get .
also , could they be sure to add a pack of cheese and red peppers ?
went into this location to pick it up .
we went on a slow day but they were still busy .
